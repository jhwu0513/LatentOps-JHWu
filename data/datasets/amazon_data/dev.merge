i changed screen protectors twice i believe in a matter of nearly a year . 
most of the time ,  the person on the other side didn t notice that i was on a bluetooth . 
to be honest ,  i m pretty neutral about these . 
the fact that it is not non stick allows for better cooking ,  deglazing ,  carmelizing ,  searing ,  etc . 
i thought it would be hard to replace but watched video on youtube and worked out fine . 
i have heard this was a good brand ,  and the video looked great . 
it s cleared up a lot of space in my pantry and made getting to my spices much handier . 
that s what makes this game so damn frustrating and boring . 
she does seem to like the merrick bg dry food . 
i wasn t expecting much because theprice was so low . 
sometimes this is hard when the surrounding danger gets intense ,  but most of the time it s painfully easy . 
after several drops the case has yet to come flying off as many of the hard cases do . 
the main issue is that the pad is located in the wrong place . 
i can t say enough good things about this great lid . 
elegant enough to impress guests ,  but sturdy and functional for everyday use .

she s unlikely to ever scratch that part ,  especially considering how big and loud  the ball part of  it is . 
cheaper then what s in the store ,  and seems to be working fine .

i am tall so i do not have the problem some other reviewers have had of seeing the gauge .

i have acne prone skin and i was hoping that it would help clear up breakouts . 
this cup set lets you see the size with ease thanks to the larger number on the handle !  .

considering the above ,  it s well worth this price . 
omg i m so in love with this cream . first off ,  the ingredient list is all natural ,  no toxic additives . 
i am very picky about my morning coffee and am willing to pay to have a quality machine . 
the case sacrificed itself  the top corner cracked  but i d rather replace a num_extend case over a num_extend iphone .

this case is just too flimsy to case a $ phone . 
the meat is only partially thawed when i slice it ,  but it works great .

i really loved it and will use it alot . 
it s quick and fun and doesn t require too much thought .

then i was trying to grap the top holder . 
i picked up an old stereo receiver for $

and even then ,  i would replay the former titles again before sending buying this one . 
i changed my kitchen to white canister ,  coffee pot ,  etc .

the extra life of these batteries was overrated . 
i wish i had paid better attention before purchasing .

num_extend +  it still does not seem as strong as the young living . 
i d love to protect my screens but this isn t the way to do it .

get a separate pasta machine ,  the stainless steel kind that breaks the pasta down into sheets of thickness .

a shame too ,  because it was not cheap . 
i do have a few scratches on the protector screen ,  but that s what its there for . 
no accommodation has been made for the extra attachment . 
but these are pretty bad ,  have purplish tent on the lenses . 
cheap ,  just parely covered the phone and it is hard to get onand off . 
and it was very unlikely to shatter if dropped . 
it fits all jars perfectly and cans well . 
i may try putting my own suction cup on it . 
salicylic acid seems to be better for me for now . 
this headset is exactly as described by the manufacturer . 
the color is more vibrant that the picture and makes it easy to find in my purse .

would recommend it to anyone who s a user of ram mount products . 
if your cold is cured after taking these for just two weeks ,  well ,  great i guess .

ergon grips move your weight to the base of your hand . 
i am a first time user so am not an expert . 
i also bought moving comfort women s fiona bra and i love it great support .

great buy !  i love to decorate my bb . 
they are not the tasty treat of the past and these were made in different country .

the num_extend i bought doesn t work properly with my omnibook num_extend
i got this phone num_num weeks after its launch mid june num_extend using it daily ,  and just about every feature . 
gotta love black goes with everything ,  and of course it s the only color men want to have . 
it keeps the square shape of the iphone without being too bulky . 
i thought it would be a little tricky to clean the blades but it couldn t be easier . 
then adding the black pepper makes it even worse .

if you re going to by a manual citrus juice press ,  buy this one . 
way to much !  the hearts are ugly and i was just unhappy . 
this game is annoying ,  it will tick you off . 
i gave it one star because we don t have a zero star option .

keep the phone clean and had no problem with it . 
its sad since they used to be my go to company .

the focus button is the only cool part of the game . 
upon putting the case on my phone ,  it snapped the power button out . 
the blade bends ,  in my opinion ,  too num_extend
they are to the t and if followed the likelyhood of messing up is slim . 
it is fairly fragile and can break easily ,  so use caution when handling it . 
fits neatly over your appliance with smoothly contoured lines . 
bought for use in making cocoa ,  french onion soup and to microwave without the handles getting hot . 
on it s high heat setting ,  it uses only num_num watts . 
this is a very nice case  ,  it fits just right and it closes and opens nicely . 
don t waste your money and just buy something else . 
only to discover to my horror that the cheap p . o . s .

it pulls a beautiful shot ,  and i love having so much control over each shot . 
unfortunately ,  these peacock brand noodles are yet another food masquerading as healthy . 
this kettle looks pretty but doesn t turn off once it boils .

this is compact ,  and does a good job of grinding . 
as many folks out there ,  including anthony bourdain i too was scared of pressure cookers . 
this tripod is suitable for a small digital camera . 
this wax seems to shine my black car quite nicely . 
the product has nothing on the label to help you know what is in it . 
i m not sure if that s my area or the phone itself . 
it dust doesn t have the width to turn those bigger items well . 
even then ,  the signal was weak and the sound quality was horrible . 
it reminds me of my grandma and my childhood days on the farm . 
and then there are the general uses ,  the logical ones that come to mind .  .  . closing bags of chips and crackers . 
the gameshark intercooler would get a num_num star rating ,  because it works as advertised . 
too bad we bought it when it first came out . 
i have brows that are fairly thin but mostly they stop short of the average length brow . 
i have bought a couple as gifts and always have a replacement on hand . 
don t know if its salicylic acid itself or if its the company s formulation . 
at least i can go to my local walmart and buy it !  . 
even with a lock on it ,  i am still weary of it opening up . 
cashed in my chips and called it quits on the sony . 
the day it came in i made french fries and they came out crisp and great . 
i wish there was an option for better than perfect service as this company deserves it . 
the original knife has s slight hollow bevel while the new knife is a low performance straight ground edge . 
it has increased my water intake easily a hundred fold . 
the numbers on each are etched solidly into the rubber handgrips ,  ensuring they won t disappear anytime soon . 
i had to shell out money for a facial with extractions to clear everything out . 
bought these to fight the glare from lights and being outside . 
she played with it for about num_num hours total the first few days she received it . 
i hang the from a hook in the kitchen . 
the cable the samsung facinate comes with allways came loose . 
give it a chance ,  you won t be disappointed !  . 
this clear one had the power button break within days . 
this pan is a wonderful addition to my calphalon collection . 
my very first cup was heaven ,  i ve never experienced such a robust ,  wonderful coffee . 
this is a rather pathetic rainbow that doesn t work very well . 
i can t wait to get home and try the bagel dough recipe . 
i just purchased this one ,  and after num_extend use ,  cut my finger . 
does not last long ,  and didn t change my cats  behaviors at all . 
two minutes in my microwave and i have a big bowl of popcorn . 
the size xl runs too small  more like a l  . 
that stand is locked in there quite well . 
it is very cheap looking and not worth the price . 
perhaps someone with bad taste will appreciate this terrible game . 
unless you have money to burn ,  i d pass this one by . 
were it not for my glasses ,  it would be perfect . 
also ,  they re not quite as large or easy to load as my canvas bag . 
i use end frequently and it should not have been moved . 
the parts were perfect and fit together easily . 
my wife s has held up fine but she hardly uses her phone . 
mine was missing the left channel when new from the package . 
this listing has changed drastically since i ordered mine num_num years ago . 
the juice tastes delicious and the consistency is smooth with a perfect amount of juicy foam at the top . 
let the casual players play madden s franchise mode . 
or just over  .  . not going up to about just below my knees . 
must be something cheap from china ,  so i tossed it . 
they seem to be pretty accurate and durable as well . 
after buying what seemed like every ice cream scoop on the market ,  we finally found perfection . 
it only takes a few times before they fail . 
i bought these googles for my son who swims competitively . 
it is a great concept ,  but it doesn t work like the bird . 
thanks so very much for an awesome case . 
i love the original mocha chip balance bars . 
so most of the calories is coming from sugar and fat . 
no worries there !  my phone and ipod were taken care of thanks to this battery . 
within a couple of days all it did was click . 
as always with cuisinart ,  quality goods !  grinds the beans quickly and easy to clean . 
i now have about num_num red bumps on my forehead that i cant get rid of . 
description needs to state the size of the adapter . 
do not buy !  do not use !  unnatural color . 
the soft plastic lid seals tight enough to use it as a shaker . 
it replaces parchment paper and it is washable and reusable . 
preheat the press with hot water while getting coffee ground and heating water . 
and i guess all of you too  .  .  . after all  ,  i dont think that the toxic cyanid . 
i had no feeding or jamming problems whatsoever . my only issue with this device is using it to stuff sausages . 
the chopsticks are nice ,  and come with grips on them for extra  grabbing  power . 
finer tastes however will reject this stuff ,  i think because it has little cheese . 
i bought it when it first came out and realized that the num_extend price tag was way over priced . 
i was very disappointed . even if the music would have great quality ,  i m not sure i d like it much better . 
the grease channel has to be dumped ,  kind of messey with a hot griddle . 
it grinds grains without making too much noise . 
just wanted to say i was pleasantly surprised when i received this today . 
it s great because of it s heavy duty material . 
if you have a choice ,  i would definitely research shun and henckel . 
if not for this ,  i d have given it five stars . 
coffee had to change the design of the tea maker and the new pitchers are squatter . 
i like being able to attach it to my belt or just hang it on my pants pocket . 
it still cooks great and cleans as easy as it did new . 
this unit worked great for about a week . 
i found that one must go painfully slow to try and prevent that from happening . 
this headset can take a lot of abuse . 
i love cast iron and this is my go to pot for baking my crusty bread . 
with that said ,  the flow on this hose isn t that great and the connectors suck . 
over num_num years ago i used a pressure cooker on a regular basis . 
it fits snuggly around both the num_num and the num_extend and slides in and out of my pocket . 
i can put salad veggies in here together and they all come out uniformly . 
you need a flat area about two inches square ,  where you want to mount it . 
i bought this ring and it is the perfect size and the ring is shiny at first . 
as soon as i opened the package i knew i made a mistake; this is a piece of junk . 
the sound quality is pretty good ,  but these headphones are not loud . 
they were dried out . you can t directly control the moisture locked in the dry kernels; only the manufacturer can . 
this product does not work for me compared to other cla products that have tonalin on the label . 
i d recommend it for anyone that wants easy access to their credit cards and id . 
yes it s a pain ,  but this is what s necessary when you must always be connected . 
the chips themselves are ok ,  without a reliable way to transport them this poker set isn t worth much . 
this is great to have on hand and a fun thing to do with kids or grandchildren . 
i bought it a sephora so i paid $ instead of the better price here . 
i found the camera to be quite good ,  though i never used any video features . 
however ,  i have become used to the screen appearance and like the way that this protector works . 
buyer needs to beware of the expiration date on the product . 
there are far more positive reviews than negative reviews !  . 
there are also belt loops but i have not used them yet . 
replaced the batteries and upon using the lcd screen the camera immediately told me the batteries were low . 
also i am plagued by not being able to use my hands very well . 
it is a clever design with a swivel head ,  but poorly designed . 
my coworker described it as;  autumn leaf red  whatever that means ,  ha . 
the scoll wheel is crude ,  and you can actually count the notches as you scroll . 
i always clean it after using and add a layer of cooking oil to keep it nice . 
keeps our counters looking more neat and organized . 
it is probably a perfect item for someone who likes quick ,  weak coffee one cup at a time . 
i bought this ball for my hyper lab and mixed terrier . 
then i worried about the quality and whether or not it would look cheap and flimsy . 
my husband usually uses my hand mixer beater to whisk sauces . 
then the top around my ribs it was too big . 
they are heavy duty and i put hot items on them with no problems . 
my friend swears by this nail polish and says it makes her nails hard and therefore able to grow . 
a box of num_num is like a one year supply for me . 
but the fm reception is so bad that this radio is worthy of only num_num stars . 
it fits perfect over the buttons and no gaps around the edge so far . 
bought this for my mother when her old bunn coffee maker wouldn t quit leaking . 
i have in and went to the the verision store and bought one that actually works . 
there was no way these would be wearable for a day at the office . 
it is protective too !  when mine wears out if it does  i will buy another !  . 
it worked great in my car and charged my phone quickly . 
the agility has a removable hood making this area easy to clean . 
the other doll s hands are super flexible andso are the legs but without a chance of breaking . 
what a well made docking device !  this was one of the fastest shipped items i have purchased from amazon . 
she had been using an otterbox commuter but was dissatisfied with that case s bulk . 
i won t take a star away just for preference . 
calphalon has become my favorite brand of cookware . 
these were significantly cheaper than the cast aluminum pan . 
i used num_num grams of flour to num_num eggs for my pasta dough . 
this knife was no exception to that; razor sharp out of the box . 
this does not dissolve completely even with hot water . 
it is so convenient we ll live with that issue . 
i had this on subscribe and save for a while . 
look great !  neutral to go with any curtain color . 
 don t try this in a top loader ,  it will probably destroy the mat  . 
great cleaner ,  but num_num stars for the bottle design . 
i`m not sure if i keep it ,  i didn`t want a regular golden color . 
about this product because of the low price . 
i have owned the game for quite a long time and still haven t beaten the first level by myself . 
just the right size for the in between jobs . 
i ve has the num_extend model for num_num months and it is great . 
i would get the bigger version of this product and not waste your time on these little darts . 
they are sturdy yet beautiful ,  and are the perfect size for pasta ,  casseroles ,  rice dishes ,  and more . 
the guard stays put for a long time . 
whoever said  not only is it not vegetable soup ,  it s not even soup  was perfectly right . 
my old ms optical mouse never had any problems . 
noisy ,  but not as bad as some . overall :  well built and a great product for the money . 
would not order this item again it does not really protect cell from breaking if dropped  :   . 
you just cut lemon in half ,  and press it on the top of the juicer . 
the sound quality is amazing for music and phone conversations . 
the only downfall is the distant between iphone and headset is way less than advertised . 
the person that i was speaking with complained about the clarity of my voice . 
i ve called ,  but haven t reached a clueful cingular support rep yet . 
my way of hitting is to just swing and see what happens . 
the pills just make it a little easier to stick to the diet !  . 
the shirt is fine if you like red and with a sateen shine . it is exactly as it is advertised !  !  . 
brita makes a great product ,  and the price on amazon makes it worth buying here . 
the flashlight is not very bright ,  i would say about as bright as a keychain flashlight ,  if that . 
at first i thought it was due to him getting bored of the food . 
the sound is alright but they are good because they block outside sounds . 
may as well just press the button on the itouch to change tracks . 
i am ok with gun recoil ,  and moving slow when wearing a bunch of armor . 
it s a phone charger for the motorola razor ,  and guess what ?  it works for it . 
i had to throw out the remaining packets after trying several . 
this machine is easy to use ,  just plug and go . 
for me ,  this handle is too big ,  and i feel like my wrist is an awkward angle . 
the rose flavor is the one highlight but there was not much of that in the package . 
the business i work at is very problematic for cell phone reception . 
i can t recommend this to anyone looking to eat a hearty breakfast . 
i used a sharpie and traced the outside holes onto the the inside section . 
the taste was bitter and sharp ,  not smooth and had a yucky  fake  taste . 
i don t like thick sleeves that bunch at the elbow while i m driving . 
i ve used these numerous times ,  and have issues only because i m kinda tough on a phone . 
it is great for traveling and using the map app . 
the size of the pan was perfect ,  and i was also pleased with the roasting rack included . 
i threw away the lilac vegetal the next day . 
i don t know how that slot will affect the temperature holding ability of the thermal pot . 
this pressure cooker is a welcome addition to my kitchen . 
i stretched the rubber band and it worked !  for num_num minutes . 
they leak ground spices out of every pore so if possible stick to using them for larger leafy spices . 
it s a great product for a great price !  !  !  cant beat it !  !  !  . 
i can t speak for the white one but the black one did crack around the volume buttons . 
it is the deep purple color of a dark purple eggplant . 
i hastily ordered her another one and it arrived on time . 
i was disappointed since i normally like the little people toys . 
i received this product a couple days ago . 
if you read my other reviews ,  i have given mostly positive . 
i was almost going to break my phone trying to remove case . 
we have used it every day for a month . 
this pan performed great searing and then braising of pork chops . 
during an average cutscene ,  the graphics look a tad choppy . 
that s about it however . i would also look at other reviews . 
it can be a bit of pain using potholders to pick them up with the eggs inside . 
they fit on very snugly ,  and the screen is just as sensitive as when the phone is bare . 
even adjusted to the smallest configuration ,  they are still too big for me . 
i have been frustrated with the treo num_extend because of its low quality external speaker . 
this one is ,  but it ll wear away the nonstick properties faster ,  so handwashing is recommended . 
so thats my only complaint for a $ case . 
my original cuisinart is num_num years old and still working well . 
the product was a waste of my money . 
i got the recommendation from cooks illustrated ,  and it works like a charm . 
they are over a month old ,  and i will probably just wash them down the drain . 
sound quality was great if you like static .  .  . cause that is all i heard . 
party is able to overthrow the emporer .  .  . yep that s about it . 
this seems to be well built ,  but i need a shoe horn to get my nexus num_num to fit . 
it also has an optical out ,  which it should . 
i use them for my fish tanks with my salts ,  buffers and chemicals . 
i love mocha icecream and thought i d love this cafe late bar . 
depending on what you use them for ,  they should last for many years . 
i got this originally for under $  used   came sealed in it s package ,  though  . 
not what the palete is expecting when it thinks it is getting strawberry . 
it is a nice heavy glass and if used for what it was intended for it will last forever . 
a good cell phone ,  but absolutely no peripheral features .  . the good :  very clear voice qualities ,  acceptable speaker phone function . 
the domed lid is perfect to keep things from splattering . 
it was very difficult to get started and keep going . 
over time i ve become a fan of oxo products . 
overall ,  a disappointing purchase that i wouldn t recommend . 
i can t even get the usb driver for the device to install on any of my systems . 
i needed this for canning items that don t do well with oxygrn absorbers like sugar . 
after about a week ,  the whole basement was a little clearer . 
these are much smaller hence do not fully encompass your ears . 
one being the loudness of the unit seemed a tad low ,  and the fit didn t seem quite right . 
i bought the charger in june and it was broken by august . 
the excellent instruction manual that comes with this cooker lists appropriate cooking times for many kinds of food . 
i gave them each the recommended amount ,  waited ,  and nothing . 
i wanted to make strawberry and i had some frozen ones that i had thawed . 
they are still wearable ,  but i really only put them on if my other two pairs are dirty . 
the background noise cancellation on this thing is the top of the line . 
typical that something so good and so long lasting ,  is not available any longer . 
i thought at first it was reading celcius but that didn t work either . 
miserable little thing died after being used twice . 
but i wasn t that impressed with it after my first use . 
i can pop it off and clean it easily . 
if you are a novice gamer ,  you will get bored with this game . 
they do not even pass the most cursory visual comparison to a genuine motorola battery . 
con :  nonepro :  it contains a sturdy yet beautiful cutting board . 
but once in a while ,  a large skillet is called for ,  and this one is perfect . 
i tried these based on the reviews and they were very stiff ,  plastic feeling and generally uncomfortable . 
people complain that the xbox version could ve been more realistic . 
those types of microphones are great for popstars ,  but i prefer a headset that is a little less noticeable . 
bought a second popper recently so we could produce more perfect popcorn at once . 
the smaller plates are great for toast in the mornings . 
i ve tried every type of head and shoulders to help and none work . 
you can go to notre dame and num_extend chicago  a perfect dark reference ?   right next to each other . 
unhappy with it ,  actually i already replaced them . 
i have purchased glass lids for many of my pots ,  etc . 
it bunches up . i purchase another one on the internet manufactured by universal surgical . 
very highly recommended because of their quality and how heavy and sturdy the glass is . 
the cables in almost all of these have cracked . 
as an alternative ,  i recommend taking a multivitamin with a glass of water . 
the num_num degree turn will works better as the waste water does not rush directly to the hose seal . 
highly recommend these to people to use on their whiteboards or refrigerators . 
spend the extra num_num bucks and get a real cutting board . 
glass is thick and durable and fits nicely in the wire frame . 
the ramp pieces just would not stay connected . 
it s not like real espresso ,  but it gets as close as you can for very little money . 
due to this efficiency ,  it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat . 
my old krups made great ,  hot coffee; i was hoping the cuisinart would also . 
very thin ,  thin weave that you can see through if you hold it up to light . 
i realized that it s just like the original ,  just bigger . 
so obviously i never got to use it ,  but i was unimpressed with the overall quality . 
everything echoes for some reason when you go down hills of streets {shrug} . 
this was a great replacement for our bodum french press . 
i use this in between with just hot water . 
keep in mind that it is slow so plan on charging overnight with it . 
i buy this product locally all the time at one of the big pet stores . 
the sequels never took my interest either . not the best fighting game by far . graphics csound cgameplay clasting appeal c+ . 
they make the water taste much better and help rid the water of nasty things . 
i have owned several shavers over the years . 
and even better ,  nobody can compare with kitchenaid s customer service care centeer . 
i was doing all these things while waiting on hold . 
uses the remote ,  and shuts off you ll probably never have a problem . 
it happened so many times that accidental pressing of multifunction button redials last number . 
my first tuna asparagus creeps in cream sauce were a success . 
have used filter pitchers and this is much easier to use . 
i was surprised how bulky the gloves were ,  they looked thin and elegant online . 
little by little ,  i am learning to make our food from scratch . 
i was first very disappointed by the smell . 
if your tastes are like mine ,  try the kopiko coffee candy . 
it does not rotate in every direction like the comparably priced starbucks machine . 
i hate using drugs but in this case it is worth it . 
at it best it puffs and goes out like the candle on a birthday cake . 
however ,  it is a bit difficult to clean . 
if i had been the one purchasing this for christmas ,  i would have done way more research . 
battery life is a little less than other phones we have had but still lasts all day . 
i may have to cut them off my rims . 
the lg optimus v  part of the one series  is an excellent starter phone for android . 
the water is just as tasteless ,  but the flow is much better . 
i am very happy with the purchase and the installation was easy . 
i use these in my overhead flexible four inch system for dust control . 
tested it against two others and it always showed the plant as being more wet than it really was . 
i did a lot of research before buying this processor . 
i m very excited about using this attachment with my old kitchenaid mixer that i bought back in num_extend
this is after i already called our isp to reboot the modem . 
isn t that the ultimate goal ?  ?  ?  this is the bluetooth headset that you need to buy !  . 
the handle doesn t stay upright ,  so the child has to be a good walker to use it . 
though i used it for a while ,  it was definetely not what i expected . 
who knew .  .  .  . i followed both machine recipes for basic bread . 
i tasted a small amount before feeding it to my daughter and determined that it was ,  indeed ,  bad . 
seller did an excellent job and sent the headset right away . 
the quality for the price of this pan is awesome . 
had to return it because it was impossible to get the time right . 
i would not buy again even at the sale price . 
only issue is when you first put them on you have to have patience and a steady hand . 
it s effective  clear  range is appx num_num feet . 
i can hear a noticeable amount of hiss and loss of clarity . 
my num_extend fits perfectly with the protective skin on it . 
i have already replaced the purse and would not recommend it . 
she says it protects her phone from being damaged if she drops it . 
update :  my newest sanyo microwave convection oven quit after working for a little over two years . 
luckily we bought it locally and where able to bring it back . 
my old charger s cable was flimsy and it stopped working right when bent in a certain position . 
i was using a griffin unit that has buttons instead of motion sensing to control the iphone . 
working at a bodyshop i have to have winter boots that can withstand the elements . 
very good price also as the same item at verizon costs almost num_extend
arrived undamaged and no broken wire like other reviewers stated . 
here are my comments regarding each set : garnet :  too dark . 
so ,  you always have to have a hot pad or towel num_extend
if you want to get rid of hair ,  try waxing . 
son has this on his nokia num_num and with use and abuse ,  this protective hard skin works perfectly . 
it turns out this battery only has a capacity of num_extend and i am feeling very ripped off . 
the snap closure on this collar is a little too easy to open . 
i gave it num_num stars because i had to return the first on . 
this holster is very cheap and the plastic clips that holds the phone in place breaks easily . 
i think oxo should stick to extrusion plastic goods and stay away from wood products . 
the fact that this had baking soda in it really means nothing . 
however ,  even if that hadn t been an issue ,  i still felt like this thing was a piece of junk . 
it was the correct item and was delivered within num_num days of order being placed . 
it is that poor tasting . i know i will never buy it again . 
a little more work to clean up after . 
i highly recommend it !  you will not be disappointed . 
but this stuff did not work right and cost nearly as much as the real stuff does . 
i got a large eye screw ,  installed it in wall opposite toilet with large sail boat rope . 
more like watch some stuff ,  play a little ,  watch more ,  play a little . 
this is a manuel machine ,  but it works great . 
i purchased about num_num extra probes for the taylor unit directly from taylor by mail . 
you better point the device right at the ir port on your camera . 
i ordered the correct size ,  sports bras are supposed to be somewhat tight . 
this fit his phone perfectly !  both of us are pleased with the purchase . 
however i wish the sides were a bit higher on the outside . 
thinking of ordering some as gifts for my friends who also have iphones . 
i went to a jewelry store ,  got a cloth and got the blue off as well as the tarnish . 
it s sturdy and well made ,  i m very happy with the purchase . 
quite frankly the quality of the character models seems of a good dreamcast game ,  or a poor num_extend game . 
the older ones had battery covers that would not stay on however . 
not my cup of tea !  but if you like spicy teas then this is for you . 
saves your hands from getting cut and lids dropping in your food . 
after a week ,  i called for a status . 
i have bought a lot of mascara in my day ,  and this is just like any other . 
you see ,  there are many filters in this machine . 
i love the blade cover; that s probably my favorite part about this . 
the cables pull the door s  up and hold the doors open . 
i really wanted this stuff to be as good as the infomercials say it is . 
some of the speech is still in japanese ,  which is pretty lame they didn t bother to translate it . 
when i first ordered i was nervous bc this product was supposed to be compatible with iphone . 
this is exactly the same as the one it replaced and works perfectly . 
at night ,  it looked like there were ufo s behind me . 
the stuff i got is in a plastic container ,  not really breakable ,  so the package is in excellent condition . 
this product works great as long as you go under num_extend in your car . 
all stainless ,  so don t worry about wearing anything out . 
excellent num_extend stars instead of num_num because of the price . 
washes reall nice in the dishwasher with no discoler attion . 
great for cutting ,  chopping and scraping ,  i wonder what i used to use before i got one of these . 
as mentioned ,  the mesh is fine enough that only the tiniest tea leaf particles get through . 
it started to have clicking sounds and searches would take num_num minutes; this was after num_num months of use . 
we submitted for a return and have switched to another brand . 
these are hard to find in local stores . 
we tried the various tips the headset came with ,  tried readjusting it ,  etc . 
a plastic blade guard would be a nice addition . 
you have to fly for minutes to find a enemy ,  and then you have to find nine more . 
the ac adapter is num_extend at num_extend amps which seems to provide more than enough voltage . 
this causes my feet to slide forward when i walk . 
they are tools . we will keep mario s ,  and move biff s measuring tools to the camping supplies . 
i m not even remotely impressed with the chatter phone . 
i opened it up and was very surprised at how cheap the attachments were . 
it also allows sending text messages through desktop  when phone is connected  . 
i ve tried adjusting the volume to see if that would help ,  no such luck . 
i was pleasantly surprised when the product arrived and did indeed have a brushed finish . 
the num_num cup capacity has always been more than enough for my family of three as well . 
this was a really good price for the cord . 
they don t stretch around the band and are consequently very uncomfortable . 
this is one of those items that delivers everything it promises . 
this will be my second of these scrapers . 
i m hoping it does not develop a rust issue ,  who knows . 
and i love it !  ! is easy to use and handles big batches of anything i want to make . 
even if you only use it to dice garlic ,  it is worth owning . 
the first two that came were absolutely filthy ,  having grease marks all over the edges . 
on my ipad num_extend series ,  it has actually charged my ipad faster than plugging it into the wall . 
so i decided to get myself a second one . 
otherwise i can find no fault with the cup . 
the handle is shorter than my regular pans ,  and the handle can get very hot during cooking . 
these are bright bags with wacky prints on them . 
so my question is what do you want to do with it and why . 
and there was a huge gap that would never close and exposed a part of the phone . 
after washing and drying ,  i held the shirt next to one of my medium hanes  longsleeve pullovers . 
unfortunately ,  this title has that rushed to deadline feel to it and it shows . 
i can still connect power cord at bottom and speaker cable at top fine . 
 backlight would make it perfect  .  .  .  .  . sound quality is pretty good ,  though not great . 
then as i was removing the product the pain began in other fingers on both hands . 
i have a french press that i ve been using at work ,  and the coffee is delicious and consistent . 
i did not bother reading the directions ,  and was able to set it up easily . 
the padding is a nice touch and there is no sag in it when its hanging from the vent . 
great coffee maker and very easy to use . 
i cant believe how much hair and dust it picked up . 
i didn t like the taste ,  it s ramen instead of udon ,  and it s just not very good . 
i had ordered two swatters because a friend had complained about his old swatter . 
the incredible was a great phone for the most part but it ate through battery . 
so instead i had to skip dinner and wash it out . 
so save your dough ,  buy any color but red . diva s !  !  !  !  what can i say ?  . 
luckily ,  i have found a cheaper alternative here on amazon that i m not allergic to . 
the eyes at the top can close and clip baby while they re playing with it . 
i really wanted to give this system a fair shot . 
in short ,  buyer beware ,  make sure if you purchase it its from a reputable amazon retailer . 
you never quite can get things done rapidly enough in or out of battle . 
must be afull small feet . this is a very frustrating device . 
another major downfall is always having a darn yankee on the cover . 
i bought this pan specifically to make corn bread . 
love this pan for cooking for a crowd or making sheet cakes . 
excellent peeler ! so many peelers just don t work that well . 
i didn t see anything special about this one that deserves a higher price . 
the bottle is leak resistant with zero condensation . 
these are cheap head phones and the style isn t too bad since they are flat to the ears . 
riveted handles are exceptionally strong ,  but make the pot a bit harder to clean . 
unlike some people who use this water for only cooking purposes  , i drink this water and love it . 
i have to wonder about safety as some do ,  with all the other deception attached to these things . 
i had this monitor for about a year and half . 
the reason i bought this was the heart rate function . 
the price of the item well surpasses any hangups one might have . 
i liked it at first ,  but the bearings failed after one year of light use . 
linksys num_num port switch num_extend ver num_extend arrived fast in new shrink wrapped box from beach camera through amazon . 
the price was right and it came very quickly after i ordered it . 
crawford describes in his excellent review of this product . 
it also uses extra num_extend from the gun to move num_num paintballs around and down to the barrel . 
it s much cheaper to buy your first items in a kit ,  rather than individually . 
the bottle says to apply over three   !   coats of base coat . 
i threw the belt in the trash this morning . 
it isn t very convenient though compared to a real lid . 
you need to balance size ,  cost and power . 
it is just so much nicer to be able to grind spices with one hand . 
it s super cheap and fits very loosely on my car air vent . 
but that s a bit expensive ,  so just look around . 
now that i have them all back ,  i m good to go !  . 
other than that ,  this vacuum is great for apartment dwellers and people who live in small living places . 
not too big or too small but just right . 
there is one more thing you should know . 
only the die hard star wars fans would pick this up . 
if you love apples and pears ,  this is a must have tool . 
there were campsites where i was the only one with cell service . 
i tried dying both my lashes and brows ,  and both were a disaster . 
because this doesn t even seem like crayola quality . 
now i see why so many people complained bitterly about these treatments . all of the brands . 
i ve been a fan of otterbox products for a long time . 
they are not the kind of girls that put there toys on a shelf and leave them there . 
i started with a $ krups blade grinder ,  it didn t do the job . 
i was able to sync this within about num_num minute to my droid num_extend
has better heat transference ,  cheaper ,  and looks and feels more durable . 
they are fabulous and indespensable if you are a cook . 
this product is awesome !  the previous reviews about the sturdiness of this product ,  i found was very wrong . 
the frog in this picture is cute ,  right ?  the one we got . 
this is a plastic shamppoer and the pieces dont install well . 
and the retractable cord is also a very nice feature . 
so ,  he started using on grill at home and had to purchase another for glamping . 
the curved shape of the premier is the shape of this little processor . 
only after i downloaded the detailed instructions from their website was i able to get it to work properly . 
it leaks when it s level ,  and faster when it s tipped swaying in the wind . 
the plastic will have some staining over time but doesn t effect the use of the product . 
first ,  the device should come with an axilliary hook for hanging it . 
i ordered these after reading the ingredient list posted by amazon and concluding they were vegan . 
the handle feels a little plasticky ,  and less grippy or weighted than expected . 
it is generic product ,  but worth every single penny . 
first ,  there are similar games with better grahpics ,  like myst . 
they almost look like they re stretching sometimes almost . 
you d actually have to start a brand new game to do so . 
i normally go though cases in a few months . 
anyways i ve been using syntha for the past two years and regret trying to go back to on . 
it was claimed that this was compatible with my panasonic cordless landline system . 
i have had my cuisinart machine for num_extend years . 
after that i gave the slicer another chance . 
it does an excellent job for a hand sharpener ,  and it is very convenient to carry . 
will review again when i have more experience with it . 
but you can use paper filters in this machine if you want to . 
as soon as i stopped using it ,  my face stopped breaking out . 
that in itself was weird since i have never used a body wash like that . 
although this case is called  rubberized ,   it more of a hard plastic case with a soft surface feel . 
we are back to buy another cordless vacuum . 
the list includes this item as well as the others listed . 
i m not very good at these things so i m sure others who are handy had a much easier time . 
after seeing similar hoses on tv ,  i was excited to try this out . 
i bought this pan because it was rated pretty good ,  but trust me this pan is garbage . 
it is a novel jewelry box or trinket holder . 
while i own a ceramic sharpening device ,  i still haven t had to use it on either knife . 
i bought this product to help even out some redness and solve mild acne . 
i would ve shipped it back i lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss . 
so basically your buying a cheap coffee maker with a good carafe . 
then it finishes with a stevia after taste !  yuck . 
i d opt for a grinder with rave reviews . 
this stuff is not cheap and this brand doesn t work as a sweetener ,  in my opinion . 
whoever posted that it was too light was just trying to pull our chain . 
they obviously have no experience or business being in the pci card realm . 
what a mess !  i m so ,  so ,  so upset with this cleaner . 
the contents will then cool very quickly . try this bowl to cool down custard when you are filling pastries . 
very small but it works great in the car . 
i took my standard bundt cake recipe and cut it in half ,  and it was perfect for this pan . 
not sure if this was from the acid in it or something else ,  maybe the cinnamon . 
this is an awesome product ,  if only in appearance . 
it is basically just a big luggage tag ,  but it does an adequate job . 
is it a wonder why this coffee grinder is rated number num_extend
iced tea machine for many years ,  but i think this product is far superior . 
when you mix with your conditioner ,  you have to pour it . 
at the highest its about what a normal phone is at its middle setting . 
we got this kit for our daughters num_extend birthday kit to make her cake . 
if you use your fido jars a lot ,  you will eventually need a pack of these . 
the price was reasonable ,  included shipping and the back arrived four days after i ordered it including a weekend . 
who ever designed this did a bang up job a good looking sleek design and looks futheristic . 
ok ,  i m with everybody when it comes to this tray . 
the amazon description says this charger is rated for num_extend but the label on the charger says num_extend
great versatility with the usb port that could charge any device . 
thanks to amazon ,  i can find a replacement at any time of the year . 
the discovery num_num seemed to fit the bill . 
it does have the cool v handle and i look forward to many years of use . 
when i told them the bargain ,  they asked me to order for them . 
layed a towel down in the bathroom and went to work . 
but .  .  .  . now i am getting a new one . i have had this product for about a year and a half . 
i would not recommend these for who would find those issues to be deal breakers . 
it seems that all of the family didn t have enough chargers . 
cant wear it on my ears with my glasses without adjusting it some since thats uncomfortable . 
one strand has already unraveled . this has been reviewed after one week of use . 
do not get magnetic ones you ll just wasted your money . 
i ve been using this product effectively for about ten years . 
case did not align up with my samsung num_extend very flexible and cheap . 
i really like how sturdy they are and how clear they look . 
the screen protector is a nice feature as well . no complaints !  . 
it almost never worked for my dog  an australian shepherd  . 
love this knife ,  a definite go to staple piece in my kitchen . 
but at this price you would think the packaging would be better . 
i had fun with it ,  although it does not merit it s price tag as is . 
this one is sturdier ,  but since it s not effective for my needs ,  that doesn t help me . 
the quilted lining is thin and pretty minimal . 
does not work . kind of sad it didnt though ,  still have half a bottle left . 
cat is not a huge fan and i really got sick of stepping on them because it hurt . 
i would never have even thought about purchasing anything that was reconditioned until i read the reviews here . 
cost $ and had plenty to choose from . 
the shipment was recieved on time ,  it worked for blackberry num_num car charger . 
it has sugar in it !  awful ,  awful ,  awful . 
this is one of the most overrated games of the mario series . 
it cooks everything evenly and it gets that perfectly done color . 
they are people who just bought the product and haven t had much experience with it . 
i originally got this product because i wanted a stylus for my ipad to mark up documents . 
don t bother buying this vacuum . your better off with a broom . 
i would skip this and just use the controller . 
i ve been buying bali products for num_num years and this is my first complaint . 
i am not computer illeterate ,  but you have to have a systems degree to install this unit . 
music and speech are rendered really ,  really well . 
i ve had my case for about num_num months now and use it everyday . 
not totally regularly shaped ,  and look a little cheap . 
i would say please don t buy this product . 
this product is made of very stiff material and has a very small opening to fill and empty it . 
compared to stevita ,  the better stevia packets don t dissolve in cold drinks easily . 
not a big deal ,  but much larger than i expected . 
as far as the filters on all the brands ,  they are basically charcoal based . 
i wanted them for playing tennis but did not even get that far . 
it s too bad they did look like nice speakers ,  a little big ,  but well made . 
i switch battery s often so i need to be able to remove the cover easily . 
i discover a filter above the dirt canister and it was clogged . 
it s actually num_num cents cheaper now in num_num than it was when i bought it in num_extend
instead of a lovely golden yellow ,  it is the light brown of a beef or vegetable broth . 
these are the best forks i have ever found for crab legs . 
they gave me a week to see if any more problems popped up . 
no damages to it and no fading color after my extensive use and changes . 
boy was i wrong !  it looks like a piece of crap once assembled . 
this juicer is a monster ,  it will juice anything you through down the tube . 
around the same time my dad got his very first iphone . 
needless to say i am still buying pam spray . 
i travel a lot by motorcycle ,  camping half the time . 
the result ,  i m not wasting gallons of water . 
work well as a serving bowl or as a soup bowl . 
compare vendors shipping charges as well as the unit price for your best purchase price . 
this is probably the best bb for the money . 
i don t know why they ship the returned product as new one . 
the machine was perfect  ,  it works like a dream . 
this bra has this weird extra nipple room that i did not need . 
right there on the front ,  in the king s english and everything . 
barely past the knees ,  it was extremely tight . 
once you use this one you will never go back to pounding your meat with anything else . 
first ,  the esrb rating system should either be trashed or severely reformed . 
i recommend them to anyone needing great value for the money . 
does exactly what you would expect it to do . 
thanks amazon and the manufacturer for good packing and quick shipping . 
it is sleek looking and it cleans up very well . 
my wife was unable to operate it . we cleaned it up and she returned it today . 
the product was difficult to install and did not cover the corners of my phone . 
really liked how grippy the sides of the phone are . 
it has a problem playing unless you put a headphone jack in the receptacle ,  just exactly right . 
the flour being enriched would not provide the nutritional value of whole wheat . 
you won t find a single mob in this game it seems . 
we received this knife for our wedding  august num_extend
i have bought two additional ones for gifts and have had dozens more bought by my recommendation . 
in that time ,  i ve managed to drop my phone several times . 
to activate discoverable mode you simply press and hold the call button until the bluetooth indicator starts flashing . 
i am pretty disappointed with this purchase ,  and will be keeping my eye out for better products . 
the only one of my gadgets it seems to reliably charge is my old kindle . 
there s a lot of work to be done . 
this phone is really cool and i recommend it for anyone looking for a bad ass phone . 
as usual ,  take care not to slip ,  because the points are fine ,  and will easily shred flesh . 
i m saving my receipt and if that happens i ll be very disappointed . 
i cannot express how embarrassing such a situation is . 
i have purchased these glasses num_num times now to have them engraved for going away gifts . 
the textured  nubs  on the back of the watch are awful . 
the colors are also very hard to blend . 
i only wear them around the house because of the wrinkling bull crap . 
it s exactly what i m looking for but no way will i pay such a criminal shipping charge . 
it is easy to use and fits the iphone num_num great . 
this was a cheap solution to my problem . 
you can t move your phone from vertical to horizontal position without using both hands . 
i don t cut raw meat on the boards ,  and ocassionally ,  i wash my boards in a little bleach water . 
i use it all the time in my recliner . 
also ,  a little indicator will come on saying  time s up  ,  and the counter start to count up . 
i took this on chance that it d help with some bruises i suffered from workout injuries . 
then ,  as others have mentioned ,  the temperature dial started sticking . 
and is the best quality cast iron cookware made . 
customer service from this company is also very poor . 
no power at all no matter what angle . 
and the steel just didn t conduct the heat to my satisfaction . 
an insult to the state of texas ,  chili ,  and your intelligence . 
first i like that the whole chassis is stainless steel . 
i like that is is very easy to clean and fill . 
nowhere on the page did i see that this is a vegetarian product . 
they really are invalueable and worth every penny . 
i have thrown out many others ,  i always have two on hand . 
i searched long and hard to find a quality charger for my phone . 
most new phones are going to soft buttons . 
she stated that i most likely had a refurbished unit ,  which immediately made sense . 
so no stars deducted for that . however ,  i like a body wash that lathers up well . 
i am very hard on my dishes and have been using corelle for years because of it . 
even my last year s camera was much better than this num_extend
the pots has a nice weight to them . 
this one is being used at least weekly . 
in my mind ,  i m owed this as i ve paid for it . 
it keeps you connected in your vehicle and with it you really are on the go !  . 
we also used it in our barbecue and surprise it worked great ,  so so easy to clean . 
we re using ciao bella book of gelato and highly recommend the purchase of this book with the lello . 
then again ,  i have serious sleep problems and have kind of surpassed a lot of natural remedies . 
i liked it so much ,  i ordered an additional one for my hubby . 
hate the remote . after num_num years ,  mine finally broke for good . 
if you are looking for a decent carpet shampooer ,  then this is a good buy . 
and all comes in a can the size of a red bull for num_num calories . i did not like it . 
it was only supporting num_extend but otherwise setup was so easy . 
she loves the shade of yellow and says it is a perfect addition to her other fiesta sets . 
hope this helps any trying this for that reason . 
no instructions are included ,  although it s possible to google some good sites . 
it turns out that making yogurt is easy; just follow the included directions . 
and maybe they ll get there if they haven t already . 
this trash tastes like cardboard packaging ,  and sugar and vitamin c added ?  i am sorry ,  that is not %
having had cheaper large pots ,  i steered away from buying this expensive pot . 
this is about the same size with the same size screen . 
i needed something unbreakable for my daughter s bathroom ,  but also wanted something reasonably attractive and this fit the bill . 
it is curved and it helps shape the loaf . 
it has a one year warrantee so this is destined for the trash  or for freecycle  . 
in some ways this is the best num_extend recorder i ve used . 
this juicer does a good job making this drink which i really can t make in the vitamix . 
i have always dreamed of a solid bluetooth headset for my phone . 
also in the drawer are many ,  many inexpensive pairs purchased at place s like bps and gander mountain . 
i m hoping we have many years of trouble free use with this machine . 
the metal they used tastes bad like they used old tin cans or something ,  and they were flimsy . 
also beware it only takes num_num bb s at a time . 
we ve had it almost num_num months and it still works like the day we got it . 
then use the back of a spoon to smooth the label ,  thereby increasing the adhesive strength . 
i paired it to my cell phone in a matter of seconds with absolutely no problems . 
this pan is the perfect size for my household . 
this screen cover does not adhere to the face of the phone well enough to be useful . 
great price and it noticeably filters tap water that i can smell coming out of the faucet . 
handles are actually a bit longer than the blade but that is the novelty . 
it says to replace in num_num months ,  but actually you should base this time on the rate of use . 
anyway ,  after using num_num screen protectors ,  i had to accept my fate . 
i bought this to hook up a metronome to an amp . 
the dogs were playing tug of war with it their favorite game  and it started bending and breaking apart . 
i found my skin was sensitive and it darken my skin . a . l . 
i purchased this phone from the best buy website . 
just recently got these and let me tell you . 
a year and a half with two kids and no casualties so far . 
i do not want the hassle of returning item but the quality of the wheels are cheap ,  cheap ,  cheap . 
you can never have too many usb chargers . 
what a piece of junk !  !  !  !  i had high hopes for this iron after reading all the good reviews . 
when plugged in it had to be kept completely motionless . 
we got it out of the box and it looked fine . 
this extended battery was excellent ,  price and product .  .  . can t be beat . 
the phone does a factory reset and you lose all info  ,  apps and documents . 
i got it set up ,  and then tried to dry some dishes in it . 
i love first person shooters ,  i ve played tons of them making me wonder why this game is so praised . 
hard to tell ,  however ,  when measuring water or other clear liquids . 
i hadn t read the ingredients until after i made it . 
they work great and especially for frying chicken to searing steaks . 
well i will blame it on this thing ,  the screws striped my rifle . 
it fits perfectly and i like how it is hugs my phone . 
linksys tech support can t offer any solutions that you can t read off their website . 
i also tightened the tension on the perch in case birds found the springiness disconcerting . 
that s just the nature of cast iron cookware . 
i feel sorry that i purchased this case it s cheap ,  and you have to build it yourself . 
it is very easy to use and has all the necessary things to make it a very handy product . 
couldn t use as styling cream too heavy ,  good for a beach day or vaca@south beach . 
they have been dropped ,  dented and scratched and still they continue to be my favorite bowls . 
i purchased in store and ended up returning the product . 
the sleeve for the nano split num_num seconds into sliding it on . 
now whenever i leave the house ,  my dogs have to be locked up . 
the cursor doesn t always respond well ,  and is very frustrating . 
my iphone num_extend connected instantly the first time i turned this on . 
if you are in need of one ,  this would be a good choice . 
ok ,  this is like the third time i have rated this . 
this review is for the net wash plus ,  not the actual neti pot . 
i suggest you give it as a gift . 
this device does both of those actions quickly . 
i replaced the bulbs with the original led s i had installed and will avoid this vendor in the future . 
if we d used the standard strips with the two lines we d have an answer . avoid computerized tests like this . 
however ,  it over heats if i use it to long without a break . 
so i don t worry about warping or discoloration of the handle . 
the key number to pay attention to is the second one ,  the rated amperage . 
bought this for my daughter and i have seen balloons bigger than this thing . 
unfortunately ,  i only have regular applecare ,  not applecare plus  plus only started recently  . 
much better price than williams sonoma and other high end cooking shops . 
the most recently bag contained mostly smaller bully sticks that reeked terribly . 
plus i ve found it to be very accurate . 
i wouldn t say that the controls are that good ,  though . 
other cloths i have purchased in the past were of such low quality that they were ,  in essence ,  disposable . 
i love this blue tooth !  i ve had several over the years and i finally decided o try again . 
this kitchenaid unit was purchased to make ice cream . 
they are low in fiber ,  with a mere num_num gram ,  and contain num_num grams of carbohydrate . 
at least they do a better job at game design . 
the lip on the top makes for pain free pressing for continued use . 
i don t mind that and just get another one . 
i like the design too ,  so i have enjoyed drinking out of them . 
the cable comes in from the outside and then is split two ways . 
so there s a guessing game in that regard as well .   . 
the powerful motor is more than enough for any job . 
so i just bought this based on the bb sales rep s recommendation . 
when it comes to wrinkles ,  well more aggressive procedures need to be applied . 
i hear it works well ,  but i don t have the experience myself ,  therefore i can t give first hand experience . 
and they make the phone easier to grip while protecting the surface . 
it is all in the marketing ,  do not fall for the hype . 
i had ozarka deliver water to my family and it was getting to expensive . 
everything fits perfectly in the case and it makes everything much neater . 
don t make the same mistake i made by purchasing this . 
the fist one was doa right out of the package . 
when i went to pull the tab to remove the phone ,  nothing happened . 
this causes the contents to loose potency almost immediately . 
i would have to bend the cable to make the sound work . 
i really wish i had seen the reviews before i purchased num_extend
i would never have thought i would switch brands but so far ,  so good with the kitchen aid . 
i was a bit skeptical of the practicality of this . 
this tire has  kevlar  in it ?  yeah ,  right . 
i saw these recommended and hoped they d improve my digestion . 
i just loved the colors when i saw this and had to have it . 
the can opener ,  also cuts down on effort . 
i heard they were made in spain ,  however i received a unit which was made in china . 
couldnt be that much harder to add it . 
no more knives or forks stuck in to do this !  i love that it will defrost frozen bread . 
the real ones are really bright without having to charge in the sun . 
i opened the box ,  set up the pool  very easy and began filling . 
second ,  the sides of my small toes were hurting as well ,  both feet ,  by afternoon . 
i m glad this works for some people ,  but it was worthless to me . 
this one was at a great price and it works well . 
all of my reviews on the chicago metallic bakeware are going to look much the same . 
the icarrier is another well built battery by them . 
i cooked chicken and steak on it the first night and it worked okay . 
many have complained about the lid or the product being thin and easily breakable . 
there s a ton on the butt though ,  and i don t sit back that far on a road bike . 
get it hot ,  just be fore it starts to smoke ,  add your rice . 
as a household with just two people ,  i find that the medium sized loaf is perfect for us . 
if it were good ,  my kids would probably drink num_num at a sitting . 
thank goodness for amazon !  i found the exact match . 
they wash up easily ,  and the plastic container is perfect for storage . 
the aftertaste is just way too herbal ,  grassy tasting for me . 
i ordered the motorola roadster num_num after owning the original num_extend motorola hands free car speakerphone for several years . 
there is also a high probability that mold could form there during storage . 
so the time on my router is off by one hour for six months of the year . 
these knives are made in china from stamped stainless steel ,  as indicated in the specs . an explanation :  j . a . 
we have num_num of these pots at church . 
yeah ,  i complain about cleaning it ,  but as far as juicers go ,  this one is easy to clean . 
the other pine tar soaps i bought didn t bother me like this one did . 
within a year the plastic tube on the shredding disk began to break . 
i love the look of this charger first off . 
frost color looks nice on the cell phone and feels durable . 
when the vehicle is flipped ,  the controllers control the same wheels ,  but the wheel positions are reversed . 
don t know if the upgrade had an effect ,  but the router never worked well after that . 
i took a key to it and it still looks great . 
can t wait for mine to arrive so i could enjoy using it too . 
keeps food warm and i am using it regularly . 
always remember that  natural  and even some  organic  standards depend on how these standards impact profitability . 
even when i push the ball ,  can t get much speed . 
i purchased a few of these to keep at different locations . 
use small amounts and use the shake method after salting . 
unfortunately it s a spell ,  so you have to spend mana on it . 
much more workable for me in our apartment than an outdoor barbeque . 
this little brewer is much better for brewing my own coffee and easier to clean . 
we re impressed with this line and are likely to buy more . 
the greenworks model will do the job ,  but not comfortably ,  or as well . 
so don t think the mouse patch makes this game playable . also ,  the graphics in the pc version are unbelievably bad . 
the i got into the menu and changed some things visually . 
i have another set from different brand but these are my favorites . 
i m also plagued by sensitive skin and break out with nearly every hair product i try . 
when i first got this item ,  it was great and had alot of fun with it . 
had no problem with air bubbles when applying ,  removed the few dust particles with tape . 
it eliminates sediment and any traces of bitterness . 
kinda as if it had been stretched out . 
i thought it was going to be a nice light beverage like herbal tea . 
the self clean indicator is a joke . i would suggest that anyone looking at this expensive model ,  look elsewhere . 
please ignore those reviewers who played a game or two and said this game was great . 
extremely well made with every size imaginable in a handly storage tin for a very reasonable price . 
i think this will be really cool when some of the bugs are worked out . 
very happy with this new addition to my kitchen . 
i cut up a ziploc bag and used it for the bottom and top and pressed another tortilla out . 
but i have other spatulas for when i need a straight edge . 
we were so happy that amazon carried this . 
i keep one in the car and others in the charging drawer at the house . 
please don t go threw the heartache i just went threw . 
see review on the chews for petite dogs . 
but lever backs don t match up . so the first time i wore them i lost one . shame as they are lovely . 
just glad that my larger dogs didn t get hold of it because it could be a definite choking hazard !  . 
i far exceed the suggested system ,  yet my game stuttered in the strangest ,  seemingly least demanding places . 
however ,  the overall sound quality both ways is better and the fit is more comfortable than the jawbone . 
i like knorr products and have used them for many years . 
however ,  if you re in the middle of cooking something ,  this can be a quandary . 
i can roast vegetables quickly in it ,  and even bake muffins . 
i got one of these batteries from oem planet via the amazon . com marketplace . 
for him ,  he gets a dessert ,  a veg ,  a salad and a main . 
practice with it a bit though ,  it can splash out if you have an odd shaped bottle . 
nintendo next year will release their new gamecube . 
this is a genuinely useless product ,  at least as far as squirrels are concerned . 
we ve had this pan for a few years now . 
since when did they stop sealing ?  the top seemed to be on snug but obviously it wasn t . 
on one hand ,  it cooks rice quick  under num_num min  and the rice comes out really good . 
it still didn t work  live and learn ,  i guess . 
the underwire was too stiff and felt like it was digging into me . 
indicating that a good portion of the gymnema has been cut in favor of the flour . 
now my phone will last for a while when i am traveling . 
does require a bit of guess work ,  but still not difficult . 
it is beautiful with a smooth ,  shiny finish . 
pour boiling water into the bottom reservoir  with bottom filter removed  ,  one half inch from the top . 
i am a true size num_num and that s what i bought . 
had this machine one day before returning it . 
juicer looks great ,  and is very well made . 
my bike was locked right outside my door to a metal railing with this lock . 
this is just an example of sega cashing in on the wii hype back than . 
contacted citi and they wanted me to send a picture of the cable . 
everyone recommends this knife ,  so no one will read this comment . 
my only complaint is the latch that keeps it shut ,  is a little aggrivating . 
i must say that i love every one of them . 
there is no use using the call function in anything but the quietest settings . 
if you make big batches ,  get a big cuisinart . 
i d send it back if i could do so without paying postage . 
i bought this as my wife has developed a taste for guacamole dip . 
i d pick a plan toys train set instead . 
this is not just for paella and mussels . 
this is so convenient when you want charge your extra battery . 
as time goes on ,  i see num_num circles of dust showing up on the tulle . 
this use to be a fairly good product . 
i cant hit the target in num_num yard after intalled this item . 
it is really handy !  my cabinet was a mess and this helped me to get things better organized . 
i pushed the pin back in and the clip is working . 
some people bash the back battery cover which is a thin plastic cover . 
i had been looking for a long time and i am delighted with the set . 
i didn t have it long and the clear bubble top broke when washing . 
i had never defrosted anything in a microwave that didn t get cooked on the edges until now . 
as long as you have a microwave ,  you ll need one of these . 
people say later you download more ,  but thats just a rumor . 
but the gist is this company sells old dead batteries ,  so you probably want to look elsewhere . 
i thought they were so cute i even put one on my daddy s ipad . 
bought this to replaced a scoop made in num_extend
the only problem i have is the gun does not feel secure . 
it lingers forever ,  long after you ve finished your last sip and it s not very pleasant . 
i immediately contacted adorama and requested a refund and paid return shipping as well as the correct product . 
i think the little bit of pressure on the button is what caused my phone to act up . 
all i remember is that it was thick and highly nappy . 
never have found anything as good at this as these bamboo brushes .  .  .  !  . 
they are good looking ,  not cheap or flimsy ,  and the mill works perfectly . 
this machine works well for me and is a breeze to clean . 
use wooden or plastic utensils and you won t scratch the finish . 
i made my favorite apricot brandy pound cake in it and it has never looked or tasted so good . 
any case with even a hint of silicone ,  makes it a difficult task to extract from my pocket . 
i have always a spare because it s not very secure to the camera . 
i just received my brand new uncle mike s deluxe range bag today . 
it needs to be a whole lot num_extend
my carver sunfire center channel speaker over powers these speakers with ease . 
for the oat flour .  .  . also use an equal amount of whole wheat flour .  .  . i have been using  quakers   old fashion oats  . 
he would pee in the toilet with no problems but this cat takes some pride with his poop . 
it gives a little extra room to work ,  and fits nicely on my oven rack . 
looks fine in the picture ,  but in person it just needs more wires i think . 
my next test was to chop my salsa . 
the three wand attachments are great for their specified purposes . 
this product did not work well at all . 
that s the only reason i didn t give it five stars . 
i got ripped off and it s not worth the money or effort . 
it definitely takes more effort to press the button ,  but it is by no means impossible or even difficult . 
it does have a nice scent ,  which dissipates in a matter of hours . 
overall ,  i got exactely what i expected which is perfect . 
this charger works well considering it is not an actually apple product . 
it works for my iphone num_num that needed a new battery . 
this purchase was not as i had expected . 
i have used this while sitting in a deer stand charging num_num iphones . 
i had solid ones before with no rollers . 
this counter undercount is awesome and i have more counter room . 
thanks amazon readers for posting your helpful information . 
you mix it with num_num ounces of water and you get this bland medicine like drink out of it . 
even while i m trying to put this game together it s falling apart . 
i used this product on all num_num of my pets ,  all with the same result . 
i should have followed suit but this was a little cheaper . 
the caveat is that it only works if you insert the device as shown in the photos . 
the next time i tried to check ,  the phone wouldn t even power on . be warned :  do not buy this product . 
my other teapots with infuser baskers don t have this problem . 
wish i didn t have to buy two though . 
i have purchased other soup mugs ,  but this is the one for me . 
the quality is very poor and the pink color is not at all the one shown on the picture . 
i have one or two other  one star  items but many four and five star items . 
bionocular has marginal optics ,  but its only $
so i am experimenting with taking filling out . 
the size is nice ,  comes with cables and adapters or just use your current usb cable . 
i finished the entire bottle anyway but the symptoms did not improve . 
and a quicker path through the filter results in incomplete brewing ,  and ,  bitterness . 
i m a huge star wars fan ,  and i pretty much have ever game with star wars in the title . 
i bought this springform pan based on the recommendation of several trusted sources ,  including cook s illustrated magazine . 
this vornado heater is pure luxury to me . 
i was hoping for the larger oxo handle like the paring knife . 
but first and foremost ,  a gadget must work . 
your phone is protected without a lot of additional bulk . 
a finer grind coffee will give you major flavor without having to use so much i found . 
vibes are not strong so if looking for strong vibes that is not your cup of tea . 
i ordered a trailer ball and it was in the same box packed loose . 
my former frother lasted some num_num years before i wore it out . 
park told me to buy a professional wrench if it is used often to remove pedals that were overtighted . 
using it to charge my galaxy num_extend right now . 
this is as good as you can get for a dollar less screen protector . 
but ,  a huge disappointment was the lid !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  the paperwork that came with the jar says made in the usa . 
do not waste you $ took me and my roommate num_num hrs to beat .  :   my money wasted . 
there s a few bits of gunk trapped here and there ,  but nothing impressive . 
after years of constant use it shows no sign of dulling . 
i am very happy with my purchase and highly suggest it to anyone who needs a mixer . 
i thought these would be great give her a little traction and keep her from licking . 
the dogtag chain relieves strain from the earbuds and can be hidden discreetly under your shirt . 
was taking product and i had to stop ,  as my stomach was very upset after using it . 
i like that the cord can be concealed in the base . 
it also stretches ,  which makes it hard to wear in tighter shoes . 
you really can t go wrong for this price . 
that said ,  the gun has a lot of nice features . 
practical and ingenious ,  we use it all the time . 
i wanted to see mars and a good look at the rings of saturn . 
i look at my kitchen stuff almost like a pet lol . 
i cannot use this item and neither can i recommend this to a friend . 
with the glass lid i can see if the liquid is all absorbed with out letting the steam out . 
i recommend it to all of my friends that have carpet . 
this is very nice i had to register this handset . 
i m far from stupid but some of the puzzles just aren t at all obvious . 
it looks as good as it did when i first got it . 
my charger works just fine .  .  . it charges my phone quickly . 
only a percolator perfectionist would really notice that difference . 
this product is excellent and unlike the comment in one review ,  i have noticed no plastic taste . 
wow ,  i was so wrong ! the popcorn maker comes in num_num simple to assemble parts and then the cardboard concentrator . 
i mounted some cambridge soundworks surround speakers on the stands with no problems . 
i connected it to three devices and it did not work . 
also ,  the warriors look like monkeys in a colorful spacesuit !  i suggest you buy some other game !  . 
so far i have found mac concealer to be the best in terms of coverage and looking natural . 
it is clean and it locks  the lock is a little tricky to work  . 
i took this and could tell no difference ,  except it turns your poo the color of the box . 
it charges anything that uses usb ,  just like you d expect . 
i bought one of these mixers several months ago and have used it extensively . 
although i have yet to test the sound isolation capability ,  i m really disappointed with its overall sound quality . 
it can also be pressed into service as a last line of defense . 
but even at this low price ,  a cable should last more than num_num months . 
is there a cartoon with these characters ?  i wasn t familiar with these little critters before getting this set . 
i thought i would get this and carry her in it when she became fatigued . 
used this to shove into doughnut holes  i cheated on actual cake pops  . 
hope you like backtracking cause you ll be doing that allot in this one . 
i also thought the lace trim was itchy . 
it looks great and i hang most of my pots and pans from it .  .  . and we re talking cast iron here . 
they re packed in there so well you need to scrape them num_extend
if you own a evo you should own this as well . 
their dmso is produced through a chemical reaction . 
the red rivets on the zipper fall out of the case . 
blade is really sharp and got the results that i was expecting . 
this reduces the suction which is critical in removing as much water from the carpet as possible . 
i had ordered this face cream along with the hand cream and the smell made me sick . 
it moves air quite fast for its size . 
i can t even get more than halfway through the first training mission without the game crashing . 
there is no  jumping around  of the appliance on the counter when it s in use . 
legitimate game companies don t need to resort to cheap tricks like that . 
the next num_num or num_num levels were the same . 
very small footprint on the counter as well . 
use plastic wrap or simple napkin over them and no problems . 
she rarely played with it after the novelty wore off . 
how about num_num mg of sodium ?  that exceeds almost all of the common brands of tortilla chips i ve seen . 
two pulses in one direction and one or two in the other direction gets most of the jobs done . 
the tops dug into my legs and i had to cut them and fix them . 
the resultant edges are smooth enough not to easily cut you . 
the case is big and has lots of room; everything else is bad news . 
it has wheat derived ingredients ,  which causes skin irritation for a lot of people . 
they are very comfortable in your ears and people can hear you very well . 
in addition to the clip ,  there is an additional loop that can be snapped around your belt . 
downfall was that the cable only worked for a couple weeks then it completely before it stopped completely . 
does not make a noticable enough difference in sound quality to justify it s cost . 
nice design ,  easy to assemble and decent quality . 
you have to build your town ,  make soldiers ,  etc . 
these arrived and are a little short but they work perfectly . 
this one is so much better than the cheap types i ve subjected myself to in the past . 
we have been using it for almost num_num years ,  with sharpening in between . 
i don t really like the taste of this compared to sugar . 
the turkey fit nicely in the pan and came out very moist and flavorful . 
the only thing better would have been getting a new mixer . 
i will keep an eye out for more to add to my collection . 
you can t just plug one adapter in to something else . 
now it s broken for the third time after having just been repaired num_num months ago . 
the armored core series has had a rusty life the last few years . 
i was not really impressed with this sprayer . 
for the life of me ,  i can t see why this game got so many great reviews . 
i tried this scratcher for my inside only cat and my outside only cat . 
the outside chrome part ,  does get very hot . 
i like to make water with fruit in it . 
you can barely tell what element something is or anything else . 
volume buttons are a little hard to get to but not to bad . 
love all the color cases for such a cheap price . 
 :  update :  i did find the directions for installation in the envelope . 
i use it as a decoration in my kitchen because the wood is so pretty . 
you would think the description would say  hose sold separately  or something to that effect . 
i got these for guppies ,  but the guppies couldn t eat them . 
it also will tell you when you have turned it off . 
i thought it would dull easily or wear down ,  after all it s only $ but i was wrong . 
the same goes for beef and pork roasts . 
charges my nokia num_extend at a fairly fast rate . 
it can take under four hours to beat it . 
the clips on the edges do not fit ,  do not clip ,  it falls apart . 
we have had these same shears for years . 
i wish i had of researched more before my purchase of this . 
found a good price on amazon and it included free shipping ,  couldn t go wrong . 
these were ok ,  didn t like real small ones . 
i read a lot of reviews on this before i forked out the cash . 
not really enough to leave a huge residue but a puff . 
i did not notice any effect from this supplement . 
dark sector s story is boring . don t even spend the money renting the game . 
the tines are flimsy and there are not have enough tines to be effective . 
i contacted customer service over the course of num_num times . 
num_extend are very unconfortable . i would not buy again them . 
we rated this lower because of what we like in a game . 
if you want to use the shuffle or program features you have to use the menu on you tv . 
easy install ,  hold great on bumpy roads and i havent had any noises or vibrations . 
the unit size is nice and there is room to fry a lot of potatoes . 
i ve only done one cake in it so far ,  but had no problems with it sticking or cooking unevenly . 
or ,  you will find yourself trying to baste quickly ,  before it runs out of the tube . 
perhaps this is an acquired skill ,  but i can t get the planes to do anything for me . 
i returned these cause the fit and the look of them didn t suit me . 
otherwise this works amazingly well in a variety of different sized pots . 
they even came out way before this dud . 
i don t own much expensive cookware ,  although i wish i could afford it . 
the stones were easy to heat in the microwave ,  and they held heat through dinner . 
you can use itunes or windows media to sort of organize your stuff on the phone itself . 
if you prefer russets ,  cut them in half or even quarters . 
i think the openings are too small to really let them swat at the ball . 
this is especially evident during cutscenes when you are required to operate the controls . 
it does a superb job of creating a creepy environment for you to play in . 
also ,  the spoken dialog is heard about num_num seconds prior to the character s mouths actually moving . 
i am going to try and interrupt the cycle to make pizza dough . 
if you get this keep it away from the hot pan if you are not currently flipping a pancake . 
i asked for this for christmas so i could make tea at my desk at work . 
even the flash works well and doubles nicely as a flashlight . + battery life . 
i have owned any number of strainers over the years ,  but never one like this . 
the challenge for me was making the drink hot enough . 
love the quality stainless ,  as well as the long slender design . 
i have the time and the inclination to can again . 
this roughness allows for food to stick on the skillet more than on those other types of skillets . 
yet ,  weirdly ,  the spandex around my ankles is way too tight . 
nice pan !  this pizza pan is a great size . 
but i can t say that i really like popcorn without that butter . 
wow ,  for the price it s a really good cable . 
i have been on and off dying and getting professional highlights for years . 
it was rather cheap ,  i ended up giving it away because it was cheaply made !  . 
when juicing ,  the motor is loud ,  but seems a lot quieter than other juicers i ve heard . 
worth buying a few or more to have in the car ,  briefcase ,  house and whatnot . 
a sony ericcson may be the phone for you . 
i ordered this bra in a num_num f which is normally my size . 
it also  basically from day num_extend always seemed to smell like burning rubber . 
very handy ,  size is great but everytime i use ,  it seems to take a little bit more finish off . 
yet my hand seems too small to fit over the ball and push the buttons . 
if you put much pressure on your head while using it ,  it hurts . 
i even wrote to krups and was not given any explanation . 
normally i love love love this product but it tasted odd and i ended up throwing it all away . 
so i was happy to find this ,  seasoned it and used it a few times ,  now it s perfect . 
it fell and scooped right underneath the egg . 
mind you ,  i received excellent customer service from the seller ,  but the product just didn t work . 
does not work as well as cheap hot filter from w . a . l . m . a . r . t . 
now ,  i love my rice sticky but there s a difference between sticky and glumpy .  .  . this was glumpy . 
silly ,  silly me . the one benefit of this is that it s rather simple to add to the ipad . 
amazon gave me the choice to return it or sell it to someone else . 
the final death blow to the sound quality comes from the voice acting . 
very durable and total molded design is great . 
this was an easy fix up for the board . 
it s quite fun to try and match the songs to the characters . 
i especially love the built in strainers in the lid . 
i m pretty sensitive to heavily scented things and it just made my stomach turn while trying to sleep . 
the second time there was a mess and the clock would not work when i replaced the batteries . 
this mitt is thick enough to protect your hands but not so thick that you can t feel the handle . 
recommended for anyone who wants to save money . 
my experience with steak has not been good and i need to experiment more . 
don t let the rest of the pot sit on the burner and then throw it away . 
this food has truly been an awful experience and i will not be buying anymore . 
i use it everyday and its been great . 
my bose bt headset just crapped out and i just bought the num_extend
now it s no longer a great deal on quality toilet paper . 
most of this can be resolved by rooting the phone and putting a custom rom on num_extend
i moved into the suburbs where the water is so much better . 
i ve purchased it three times and each tube has lasted less than a month . 
normally i m partial to the oxo stuff ,  but this juice press is miles better . 
having the right tools makes any task easier . 
most aren t related to how the top is screwed on or the filter basket is latched . 
all you have to to is clear the cache . 
you release the lock mechanism at the top and press down . 
i m amazed that i never get any unpopped kernels ,  as i did with microwave bags . 
the eye relief is still num_num and i must take my glasses off . 
the kids are not basically making up what they do as they go along . 
you can use it to rest ,  flatbreads on it ,  too . 
i foresee the vacuum being released like the other reviewers mentioned . 
it comes with a dough hook too even though i didn t see it in the description . 
oh ,  by the way .  .  . you can wash these holsters ,  too . 
frankly ,  after num_num weeks of use ,  i could not tell if it worked or not . 
it makes a perfect cheesecake and now i m planning on ordering another one . 
most of the plastic continues to break of every time i use it . 
this compared to the old pointy apple corer . forget this one . 
not even one month ,  it was borken already ,  and i don t really use it that often . 
get the ground hogs ,  you ll get what you pay for : msr ground hog stake kit . 
don t put in ear while crazy glue is wet . 
air vents like the ones in some of the other review pics are the ones it works with . 
that means debris from whatever you re using them for will fall into the palm area . 
my wife and i gave up on this game after becoming frustrated with it . 
i tried to take it apart ,  but you can t without breaking it . 
my phone runs hot while charging ,  however it does charge . 
no soap or abrasive cleaners of any kind . 
what i do is this : i use the double fold method and put it in as the directions say to . 
i kept thinking i must be doing something wrong . 
they went on fine ,  but i wouldn t buy them again . 
that was unplesantsecond ,  they taste nothing like pomegranate . 
but i seem to be a little bit sensitive to num_extend and apparently i m not the only one . 
it doesn t state artificial flavorings in the ingredients list on amazon .  .  .  .  . but they are listed on the box . 
it s ideal for those recipes that combine measures ,  e . g .  ,   one cup plus two tablespoons of sugar  . 
as for the pan itself ,  i couldn t be happier with it . 
i have gotten no complaints from people i call and am on the phone a lot . 
i love green tea ,  i love pomegranate ,  and i love flavored teas . 
and so far i tried twice but it doesnt really show any color on my face . 
i think they ll last as long as i want them around . 
i need to up my game to keep up with my new board . 
boil water until timer darkens to your specific needs . 
the rolled top edge makes it easy on the hands when cutting mulitple cookies etc . 
however ,  the baker in the family will want a nice clean silpat for her christmas cookies . 
i bought this for my motorola droid num_extend
it was very flimsy as well ,  and didn t work . 
this cover fits it nicely and together they do make a statement of color . 
i had a frame fit silca as well as a zefal in the past . 
great for slow cooking baby food and for dips at a great price . 
we use this every morning making our espresso . 
on the whole the gameplay tries to deliver an adequate amount of mayhem . 
we ran over and pulled out a large wad of threads from his mouth and throat . 
this one will be coming out much more frequently . 
what were they thinking ?  so glad i could still find the digital display foreman . 
they clean up in the dishwasher easily too . 
did not stay together well and was advertised that it folds and did not fold ,  sent back . 
there needs to be room at the top of kettle to contain boiling water . 
i normally purchase the smaller can of evo ,  but the % my cats would not touch . 
i bought this one because the original cable i had was ripping apart . 
it s all peach ,  i don t taste any tea . 
the scent is still kind of strange ,  and on your face scent definitely matters . 
all i can sa at this point ,  try at you own risk . 
the product arrived in its original case with game booklet . 
i was actually pretty impressed with the sound quality of these headphones . 
so glad i didn t go to bed with it on not realizing the issue with this new formula . 
i bought num_num sizes of the golden holiday tablecloth and matching place mats . 
it really just sits lightly over your ear . 
they really don t get a lot of use because they re just a little too small . 
zucchini ,  cucumbers ,  cabbage ,  sweet potatoes ,  etc you can t feed faster the chute faster than this machine can work . 
this is a must have for anyone who has a cell phone . 
they clean easy ,  lightweight and take no space to store upright . 
it is a very nice and cute pan but i will not start out with damaged goods . 
you have to cut the cord in half . 
i purchased this item because there re good review . 
the best thing about this is that food doesn t stain the inside . 
we cook hamburgers ,  steaks ,  hot sandwiches ,  the possibilites are nearly endless . 
it s so small i didn t even see it for what it was . 
you have evenly cooked ,  crispy pizzelles in no time . 
the knife blades slide in and protects the blade . 
nice and heavy ,  very solid and easy to use because of the heft . 
there are different types of burr grinders but the conical type is supposed to be the best . 
i d had non stick fry pans up until now ,  they worked fine ,  nothing wrong with them . 
for the price ,  i expected a little better . 
ever since then ,  i ve always opted for colombian coffee because of the rich flavor i got out of yuban . 
i bought this item to listen to much while i ran . 
but that was the first bag we bought . 
vegetable volley  series num_extend  japanese :  bulldoze your way through num_extend
still no one could hear me talking and what they did hear sounded like an echo . 
i own several timers and this is my favorite . 
very nice sauce pan i used yesterday all the long and it was easy to clean . 
all is good except the outlet hole is too small . it would be perfect if they made the hole bigger . 
although i bought these pedals along with mountain bike cycling shoes ,  the fit was poor . 
they never really liked this thing even though it gives my two big fat rats more room . 
whether you ll like the scent is another matter . 
the key .  .  . you have to remove the phone from the case ,  which is very inconvenient !  . 
no matter how much praise or how many treats i stuff in their face . 
i know a lot of people who have merrell s so i hope my new pair is a good fit . 
for me it was a waste of money . 
warning :  num_num grams of sugar reminds me of the horrible orange drinks they give you for glucose tolerance test . 
just like all the other denman brushes ,  the back of the brushes slide out . 
they re also made in china now ,  which i don t like . 
unfortunatley my cat does not seem to mind . 
it took num_num weeks of non use for the itching and swelling to completely go away . 
although they liked it ,  it did not fitmy standards or liking . 
it works like a charm and you really get a very similar product . 
i would change it to num_num if it were possible . 
i found this product to be very clumpy and gloopy and smudge . 
that s very accurate and i wish i d paid more attention to that feedback . 
i personally have no need for a kickstand so this works great . 
i know many people swear by this product ,  but i think it is a crappy product . 
the straight sides allow for a cake that will be even and beautiful . 
first it has a light grayish color to it . 
this thing must be on the slow boat from china . 
these kitchen shears rock and are in heavy rotation in my kitchen . 
the first is a two piece hard shell that snaps around the ipod . 
i bought this because it happened to be top rated based off a youtube video i saw . 
for the price ,  i doubt you can find a better carving knife . 
easy desgin ,  just slip your finger in and it slices through the peel . 
plug the device s bulky power adapter in and press the button ,  and wait . 
the pictures will show two spots ,  one half of one i had already cleaned before i took the picture . 
i have tried all manner of other ways to integrate my iphone easily with my car . 
also ,  you do not get the lightening bolt on the battery icon to indicate that it is charging . 
bought these because of plans to take cakes to fund raisers . 
i am hoping it will last her through several years ,  but we will have to wait and see . 
we got this after our old beater began to flake off . 
i called kodak and was advised to download their new software . 
and the lid covering the grinding chamber is screwed on so no more leaky mess . 
either they do not fit properly ,  or they do not last . 
after many hours ,  i just put the battery into the phone and it was fully charged . 
but the illumination does not turn on at the desired time . 
it used to be the best wax on the market ,  they must have changed the ingredients . 
the price is right and so is the item . try it , you ll like it too . 
not everybody is going to dish out thousands of dollars for an ampliphier or some stereo . 
i have given several way as gifts and they were all pleased . 
 hey it s been a while since i used this . 
the charger worked fine for a month ,  then just stopped working . 
it saves trips back and forth to the kitchen if we re spending time outside . 
i understand that the num_extend is aging hardware ,  but i ve seen some damn beautiful games run perfectly on it . 
i ve used marble runs from other manufacturers and have not experienced this level of poor design . 
within the first week the metal plates had fallen off . 
but the thing is ,  i don t think they should bend . 
i have two small children ,  perhaps enough said but . 
loved the colors . then i go check out walmart s mainstay version of this . 
i attempted the electrical tape fix i ve seen on youtube ,  but it did not work . 
i purchased the lenox  holiday nouveau  num_extend round tablecloth to coordinate with several lenox holiday nouveau serving pieces . 
it hugs the phone tight enough that many people won t know you have a case on it . 
update :  obviously i caved in and got the num_extend anyway . 
i returned it for the larger model that i like . 
besides that it has been a great case . 
i bought num_num blades and am stuck for a while . another gillette marketing gimmick that ,  for me ,  does not deliver . 
the changing lights are definitely adding to the novelty . 
i am hoping i can give them to a friend or to a rescue group . 
worse than the one that was in the phone . 
it is very sharp ad makes peeling very easy . 
i have a strict skincare regimen and when i heard all of the reviews and how its so great . 
this product flaked off of my nails within hours of application . 
my vet suggested one of these based on her assumption that my dog is anxious . 
i do hand wash ,  immediately after use and then dry . 
i knew coming in that this game wasn t going to be the madden of old . 
i would recommend this paddle to any of my friends . 
given that leather is a great selling point ,  it s hard to believe that this would not be printed somewhere . 
i would rather do without coffee than to drink this . 
there is nothing special that designates that this is worth num_num dollars . 
recommended for people who cook small to medium amounts of rice at least two times a week . 
even my son who is a boy scout loves it to sharpen his scout knife . 
the discount cards for places like cvs ,  walgreens ,  etc  . 
in the picture ,  they look small ,  which would be cool . 
they re made of glass so they behave more like pyrex in the microwave . 
in my trip ,  my daughter and i eventually took turns to carry the bag . 
my computer crashed recently and took the hard drive with it . 
works well ,  keeps things moving smoothly ,  and helps to keep clean up faster . 
i use to make my tea in big quantities since i drank so much . 
the price isn t bad for what it gives . 
my fiancee picked it out and she loves it . 
rv s are subject to much dust not to mention we change environments  pollen types  on a continuing basis . 
make the bread crumbs for my chicken supremes or chicken kiev ?  check ,  check ,  and check . 
do some research and you will see that other gamers have the same complaint . 
would highly recommend for anyone wanting to grill inside . 
the shoulders stick out several inches past the hole where the arm sticks out . 
again ,  xbox owners get leftovers from a num_extend ported num_extend
i have purchased these for gifts as well . 
rezound  ,  the thunderbolt s screen is noticeably wider and negligibly shorter . 
for the average kitchen i suspect this would last a lifetime . 
this means that when cooking steam will condense there and oils from food will also collect there . 
this is really a great buy for about $
it literally ripped off my skin ,  and left me with bruises . 
i just received the num_extend screen protector and i would definitely say that it is made of good quality . 
but as the unit bumped and moved along ,  i was quite amazed at the cleaning power of the roomba . 
i bought these mitts for the high reviews but i was insanely disappointed . 
but ,  hey what do you expect for a num_num mah beast . 
it will lighten it even more than that ,  if you can get it all the way through your hair . 
this is extremely important to avoid any num_extend the lid grip is thin and hard to remove . 
we ordered several different colors and patterns ,  all by rothco . 
best case out there for an extended battery . 
it took me a few applications before i got good at it . 
i personally think its because these are fanless ,  and seem to overheat very quickly .

when i look at its picture while ordering i never think it should be same as in the pics .

most were almost like new while only a couple cards appeared very used . 
plastic very sturdy and holds up well to the microwave heat . 
this shaker is all glass and stainless steel . 
i wish it would just beep until i shut it off . 
the mat should be connected to earth ground or placed on a grounded surface .

all the rest is good . the phone is terrific as a phone . 
love this dinnerware ,  have had a complete set for about num_num years and they are still in great condition . 
i really enjoy these with my wok cooking . 
it s easy to install due to the slight stretch in the plastic . 
and dont want to carry a purse or wallet . 
anyway ,  if you need the right angle ,  then it will be a num_num star review for you . 
i ve had this unit for a few years . 
when i switched makeups ,  my face totally cleared up . 
well worth the money ,  and perhaps nail polish could replace the markings that wear off ?  . 
i bought this tea on a whim thinking it would be perfect for this autumn and winter . 
the num_extend uses a regular sim so swapping this sim isn t possible without this adapter . 
maybe you need some silocone in your hair sometimes just to be able to get a brush through it . 
you can t change from num_extend to num_extend person .
