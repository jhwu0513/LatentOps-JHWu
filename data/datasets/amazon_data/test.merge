unfortunately ,  not my blackberry nor my cell phone . 
if your bike had a kickstand on the plate it won t lock down . 
there is no menu selection for find free books . 
the inside of the case that contacts the phone is not smooth at all . 
armada lacks the epic scope of similar games like homeworld or even starcraft . 
the sound is also very surprising for the price and is enough for me . 
i also love it because the jar is plastic . 
good thing filters for num_num gallon tanks are cheap . 
i m just looking forward to the day i get to replace it . 
the item was considerably different quality than pictured . 
the measuring spoons would make a great stocking stuffer for any kitchen queen . 
not the fastest but better than my other hot air brush . 
it works as expected and is just the right size for the camper . 
it took three years three vets and over twelve hundred dollars spent before success . 
i could feel some of the grains even after much shaking . 
i tried supergluing the magnets back on to no avail . 
even after several days ,  they are air tight in a wine bottle . 
this is called cheating !  i expected canister with fuel at least . 
it is best to invest in a good set of makeup brushes . 
i use is for more than deep frying . 
and still the focus was extremely soft or just plain terrible . 
need a cheap car charger and it seems to do the job . 
if you are sensitive to maltodextrin ,  this isn t for you . 
you dont get so much sand with this . 
i did not buy from a num_extend party seller . 
i like almost everything except cucumber juice  echhh  . 
i was hoping for a bit better than this from amazon . 
i was concerned for the price that these measuring cups would be flimsy . 
it is easy to clean ,  but honestly i rarely clean it . 
but i like the phone to be up higher on the windshield . recommended . 
i use these reviews so heavily that i want to give back . 
i am glad that i did not spend a fortune on the electric models . 
this cord seemed like a deal and got good reviews . 
very easy to put on ,  no bubbles whatsoever . 
you can go to any chain store and do better . 
i will always have slight pain ,  no matter what . 
 the bowl is too light  we even had it on a rubber mat . 
if you can afford it step up to something that will last . 
obviously we all have our own preferences for taste . 
that is not to say that these treats are bad by any means . 
i didn t have the rust problems that others had . 
however ,  definitely does not work like a new battery . 
it works fine and the coffee is just as great !  . 
these run quite small even though they are stretchy . 
i wouldn t trade them but this is a great knife for the price . 
i was glad to see it was still available . 
would suggest using one of the toy bubblers amazon sells . 
i only wish the vacuum head was a little larger . 
we usually run it on low and it is relatively quite . 
perfect size for preparing dishes . it really works well . 
this does not appear to attract more mosquitos than the light does by itself . 
otherwise ,  they fall off your head at the slightest lean or tilt . 
no problems with this and worked with many devices . 
i shall be ordering a second one in the not too distant future . 
for some reason it worked out terribly for me . 
like showdown : legends of wrestling , it has too many glitches to count . 
i wore my first one out by pouring hot gravies in it . 
dash mounts are either bulky and in the way or not strong enough . 
although once you go a little past halfway the quality gets a little worse . 
i ve been using this for months ,  and like it very much . 
if you have soft facial fair then by all means use these razors . 
well it made it worse like a rubber band texture . 
the balm is crap more like a vaseline stick . 
the transmit strength on this compact num_extend is pretty strong . 
i had to buy one out on the road . 
toasts bread ,  muffins and bagels with lots of options to choose . 
what a change in my life this will make . 
delicious over fruit and kashii go lean crunch cereal . 
the cables seem rather basic and work well ,  except one problem . 
very hard plastic and not that fun to play with at all . 
making seperation and cross contamination containment a very easy . 
this is the old faithful water filter pitcher . 
item arrived in num_num days in bulk packaging exactly like j . 
first ,  i put them both under my tongue simultaneously . 
i d rather be a little less healthy and a little more happy . 
but it s not bad for wireless ,  i ve had worse . 
it holds the charge like when my phone was brand new . 
like they glued it together and shipped it out it seemed . 
i have two of them in different locations in my house . 
try explaining to a two year old why her tattoo keeps  breaking  . 
all in all ,  though ,  happy with the product . 
i thought i was over charged once it was returned . 
this is the best cookware i ve ever owned . 
would have been alot nicer if it simply threaded in with the correct alignment . 
it moves plenty of air ,  oscillating between two rooms . 
my goof to not research this brand more . 
also the headphones do not feel comfortable on your head . 
it really is like they didn t take anything at all . 
i think this size wont do a bigger bird than num_num pounds . 
there are companies that make dog biscuits with the activated charcoal in it . 
the recipe that comes with it is tasty . 
coming from an asian background it s not something we normally cook with . 
obviously the margin of safety  from overflow  is much smaller . 
then i put the cream on my feet especially around my toes and heels . 
birds or squirrels . tried num_num different kinds of bird food . 
i do not like this belt because of lack of material . 
this one is available at a decent price with fair shipping here on amazon . 
it stays stable in your ear very nicely and is surprisingly very comfortable . 
to ataris credit ,  this game was a bit fun . 
as the clock clicked by num_extend i still felt sluggish . 
i can t believe how strong this little guy is . 
one to another company and two to amazon . com . 
the pair made in mexico is much better . 
i installed this on a horizantaly sliding window . 
i don t want the bulk of an otterbox defender . 
is that what you re looking for ?  go elsewhere . 
it makes an annoying sound when it is on . 
i might return it ,  but i need a can opener . 
this particular variety is rather lacking in the flavor department . 
mind you the oem xoom charger is not like that at all . 
tastes in between the classic american blonde ale and cowboy golden lager . 
i use it for my line of work and it stands up . 
it keeps it the coffee hot and fresh for hours . 
its actually a little better than the filter that came with the unit . 
i ve not had this happen with my wusthofs . 
i would not buy anything else from this vendor . 
apparently there are thirteen more words required to successfully submit this review . 
with this i say i work giving support to the u . s . 
it didn t work for me hopefully other people will have better luck . 
careful when using steak knives however because they will scratch these plates . 
i am so glad we chose this one . 
hope this lasts longer than my last grinder so can buy as a gift . 
this is the second one of these i have purchased . 
$ is too much to pay for a $ cable . 
claritin used to be the best thing around . 
the cars that come with this garage are cute . 
very nice unit ,  easy to assemble and operate . 
 the last time i did it was a year ago  . 
i have been using it twice a day since i received it . 
it basically picks up what is directly in front of it . 
i pretreated the worst stains withwoolite pet stain . 
fast; better than a blender and is easy to use . 
i m selling mine to make room for something else . 
also ,  don t use that yellow cloth to clean your phone . 
the entire thing fits in the palm of my child s hand . 
i will update my review after num_num months . 
the metal is very sturdy and the non stick finish is great . 
for my purpose this is the perfect item . 
i kept it though i do not use it . 
the la prima ran about half a shot then choked the machine . 
it pushed right through the job with no trouble . 
i ve learned that companies make varying degrees of quality . 
i guess you could say so what it s a ladle . 
however ,  this is an example of how rosle got it right . 
it did what it was supposed to do . 
i can t believe i haven t owned one of these before . 
it fulfills my modest requirements ,  and exceeds my expectations in appearance . 
we are ice cream lovers and fussy about the quality of ice cream . 
the head set is quite comfortable  at least for me  . 
i read all the reviews and decided on this one . 
seems to working fine in my mother s humidifier . 
that is right up until one day the record feature stopped working . 
no complaints and my wife loves the color . 
he enjoys this toy ,  but can get the treats out fairly quickly . 
don t waste your time or money on these jeans . 
after all the great reviews i thought i d give this a try . 
this knife sharpener more than met our expectations . 
i have had to replace the paddles as they wore out . 
this style of meat pounder is sort of commodity like . 
me too is a nice brand and make very comfortable shoes . 
and theres no warning on any of these cans that i can identify . 
camera fell of it after a few uses . 
should have a wider design for different foods . 
i bought this to grind xylitol and truvia sweeteners into a powder for cooking . 
i say that after trying many cheap pathetic headsets ,  sigh . 
it stores in a really small place and is built to last . 
i have many oxo products ,  and i ve always been pleased . 
i can see i will be using it a lot . 
not a good product for conditioning even though it says it has shea butter . 
we ve tried num_num of these waffle makers since jan num_extend
it is too bad because the ingredients looked to be quality . 
the otterbox defender series is by far the best available . 
do not buy this product ! the photos are horribly ,  horribly misleading . 
sometimes i m there for up to num_num hours . 
i dropped phone once and the case held up perfectly . 
and it ll keep rice perfect and hot for up to num_num hours . 
i would recommend to anyone who wants a pda . 
fits perfectly ,  cutouts are plsced where they should be . 
tablets charge slowly ,  but that s to be expected . 
does increase volume but does not feel nice to the touch . 
puts together very easily and does what it s said it would . 
so i bought this product hoping it would help to regulate my cycles . 
avoid the heartache and wasted titme of bad discs . 
it stay clean and does not collect food stains . 
because it s too big for my cup holder . 
the same panel buttons are there but in a better placement . 
i then emptied th coffee grinder and looked for an obstruction ,  none . 
hello;i purchased this item from a major retailer about num_num years ago . 
we have used ours at least a couple of hundred times . 
she didn t like the handle of this one at all . 
these type honeywells have been around a long time . 
they were huge ,  yet the same size in the leather is tight . 
they also make noise if you happen to touch one against the other . 
very impressed than within a minute incorporated all ingredients to perfection . 
we juiced our garden lettuce and greens with ease . 
there must be an engineering issue with the motor of the toy . 
this keeps the cord out of the way and above the board . 
my first suggestion to anyone reading reviews on this product is to keep looking . 
no more oil on my hands when cooking up a steak or falafel . 
like how many times you face the nazgul and how easily they are beaten . 
it was all potatoes and had very little clam flavor . 
this pan i have had for one year . 
good that they are from usa and not china !  . 
i just bought a num_extend cubic ft chest freezer . 
you place all the ingredients into the bread maker . 
as i get hit ,  my health endurance goes down . 
there were other vegetables included ,  but you really couldn t taste them . 
i tried everything short of breaking the thing open . 
however ,  slicing up tons of veggies can be quite time consuming . 
i received them as a christmas present and i love them . 
also cheaper than going to the grocery store . 
i have purchased fairly cheap holders from motorola and they lasted a while . 
it creates heaping folds of foam andturns your coffee into a breve latte . 
the tiny green light on one side is very bright when fully charged . 
it just smears it around until the water evaporates into the air . 
just wipe the plates with a paper towel . 
carrots will leave a big orange smear on the surface . 
may be it will become soft with use and then it should be fine . 
they would flip off or get hung up due to poorly rolling wheels . 
it opens cans ok ,  but no better than the old fashioned openers . 
i have never had a pleasant experience with the customer support at cuisnart . 
i can hear the caller clearly ,  vice versa . 
i had installed two of these for the front entrance of our house . 
they were awesome and they work great i like them a lot thank you . 
i have had this mount for about a year and it works great . 
it has a num_num year warranty on defects too . 
i don t know how i ever managed without this handy devise . 
the handle is comfortable and holds the pitchers securely in your hands . 
i ve had this thermometer for about num_num years . 
these tongs seem to have the locking mechanism backwards . 
researched before i bought it and had actually chosen another one . 
i guess maybe there are some people that this product could help . 
it s good to go the next morning ,  completely clean . 
there was almost nothing i liked about this product . 
this one sits on our shelf collecting dust . 
sharp cutting edges make your pies look as good as they taste . 
these definitely open up your nasal passages and functionally work as advertised . 
this product is being used for dollar size pancakes . 
i also love that this griddle doubles as an indoor grill . 
i think this case is a very nice phone case . 
i had much better luck with the other three pairs mentioned . 
i have been extremely happy with my purchase . 
 : pi also have limited space in my kitchen . 
the instructions came over the motorola num_extend and were very clear . 
i really like how this counter protector curves over the edge of the counter . 
i have no idea if it s me or this product doing . 
all my testing proves the same . hope that helps . 
worse ,  the controls are so confusing that it gives me a headache . 
its tollable but thats not the best thing to say about headphones . 
i like the oster steamer ,  it does everything it claim to do . 
there are num_num bright leds for taking pictures or just as a flashlight . 
first of all ,  syrup shouldn t run ,  it should ooze . 
because these knives will greatly appreciate on the collector s market . 
doesn t get stuck on the rod like some non rollers do . 
i ve owned this crock pot for several years . 
i practically felt like i threw away my money on this one . 
i d rather tie a towel around my neck as a cape . 
i tried hiding them in her food and in her treats . 
bought this for use to hold my droid incredible . 
i recommand smaller size for everyday use . but i like this pan . 
after a num_extend try i received the same product . 
this happened after about num_num years of use . 
just make sure that you don t misplace the spout stopper . 
most pizza wheels that i ve seen are much smaller . 
hopefully you won t have to go through this nonsense . 
i could not tell a difference at all . 
then i used the attachemnts on my furniture and the water was gray . 
for example ,  the box says there s an led battery indicator light . 
i hate myself for falling for the james bond license and wasting $
i though it would be faster and easier but it wasn t . 
ekobrew ,  the coffee always stays in that bottom wedge section . 
it works great and i am very happy with it . 
i also have to hold the headphone cord to keep it from flapping around . 
absolutely horrid; cheaper @ costco if you must . 
surely not worth what was paid for it by half . 
make sure the pins line up with the contacts . 
i m not sure why this grinder got so many mixed reviews . 
just reinstall the previous ghost recon and raven shield games . 
another num_num calories from the other num_num grams of carbohydrates . 
a meeting my phone is in the bag charging . 
i mean she felt apart she broked down in a hundred pieces . 
that s what it does and it does it well . 
purchased this to charge my new android tablet in the car on trips . 
i have no padding of my own to offset hard soles . 
i made flour tortillas that night for our mexican burrito dinner . 
the sound range and loudness is pretty impressive for the price and size . 
i don t know why it has all the good reviews . 
nightwolf s friendship is cool too where he juggles his hammers . 
try it once and you won t think it s stupid . 
no comment on the strainer since i have not used it yet . 
and that would be what you would need . 
product arrived on time and was wrapped well . 
the copper finish is coated with a clear plastic to prevent oxidation . 
so what it comes down to is that u get what u paid for . 
i purchased these batteries based on the reviews of others . 
love the way these roll instead of sliding on the rod . 
i was surprised as the box seemed to be in good shape . 
because it is definitely not worth full price . 
my first draft of this review was also way too long . 
the good pieces that i manages to salvage the birds refuse to touch . 
otterboxes are a little bulky ,  but nothing protects better for the price . 
since that time i have replaced the game . 
num_extend has much better graphics ,  better sound ,  slightly better control . 
they are thinner and retain memory than the older ones . 
it works for maybe a few minutes and wears off quickly . 
i would not buy this again in the future . 
hasn t had to be rebooted yet due to connection issues . 
nice not to have a burner going for hours . 
this is just a little too low quality . 
this headset is awesome ,  the sound quality is truly amazing . 
the quality is declined quickly by heat exposure . 
this item works just as i thought it would . 
finish is great ,  and it makes great french toast . 
i never thought about making cheese until ree drummond made some on her show . 
this item does not provide full coverage as the picture suggests . 
and i have tried a lot of them . 
i could barely get through it they taste so nasty . 
i bought it for a new iphone num_extend
the roomba just thinks it s furniture and doesn t go up on it . 
i like it better than any of the forman items . 
it makes a farce out of a good num_num num_extend
it was supposed to be a complete toy . 
i put in a password but router won t recoginize it . 
then contact sharp and go on from there . 
so ,  this car looks cool and all but its not that great . 
i reported it havent heard a word about it . 
i won t give this to the new puppy i m getting . 
i used this set with a toaster oven and with a coleman camping oven . 
maintenance cleaning is fast ,  neglected cleaning takes more time and repeated cleanings . 
i love the floral design and the colors . 
this is not at all expected from a respected brand like sony . 
the first time through ,  things really slowed down around level num_extend
don t buy this unless you like replacing toasters . 
this product does what it is suppose to do . 
that s not what it felt like with the original gel adhesive . 
when i contacted the company the response was that they shipped it . 
it didn t fit in my bathtub ,  which is a standard size . 
i ll just stick with a good mayo and skip the bacon . 
snug fit ,  with all the buttons and holes perfectly aligned . 
i will never again purchase another game where this is a requirement . 
i simply treated it how i would assume a curling iron works . 
with a couple of bucks you could make something a lot better yourself . 
it s like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends . 
this casserole dish is the perfect size and i love having a nice lid . 
take the whole thing out in the sink . 
the case zipper shuts with a flap that covers the zipped part . 
it was the finger next to his hole finger . 
 i used a blade grinder for years before buying a burr grinder  . 
wrapped around me easily to tuck in for getting ready at the gym . 
i thought the concept was good; scuffy thinks otherwise . 
one great feature is that the spatula head is removable for east cleaning . 
i contacted q cell and they replaced the back cover . 
if you get these just be a bit careful . 
the braun has it all . this is my second programmable flavorselect . 
i will still continue to use philosophy products ,  just not this one . 
with medium usage its closer to about num_num hours . 
spend the extra bucks and get the chopat knee bands . 
so ,  to me this is pretty darn  instant  . 
it makes a buzzing sound when devices are plugged in . 
i believe it was about $ when it came to market . 
i used this along with another similar product ,  for over num_num months . 
might have been nice ,  but just went over my cheeks . 
i use this thing to core out the inside of a potato . 
i got this as a gift for my son . 
i may even give some as gifts this holiday season . 
once glitch ,  which i did not view as all that negative . 
and it is very possible that these are good cables . 
it comes at a good price and appears to be well made . 
they come with full instructions and not much more to say . 
taking it out of the box i found the design to be awkward . 
i have no doubt that it will hold up well through the years . 
blade release buttons are simple to use which makes cleaning easy . 
i made beef bolognese in the oven and it turned out wonderfully . 
then along came this zester which i use constantly . 
i don t think pie weights are for me . 
easily moved to various locations depending on need . 
it s almost like putting the phone into a high end pair of socks . 
for me this was a most disappointing product . 
if you are grinding dry items ,  it should be ok . 
they pee in it about once a week ,  if that . 
i purchased the frieling to replace a glass bodum press that broke . 
thank heaven the operation is intuitive because there are no instructions . 
my cat just isn t at all interested in these springs . 
wish it had a crank or something to make it easier . 
now i have a game that i don t ever want to play . 
in this case ,  it s a big disappointment for num_extend
they are cheerios ,  afterall ,  and we love the original kind . 
put homemade pizza sauce on top then add pepperoni and fresh mushrooms . 
the cord is extra heavy to resist tangling . 
very sturdy with a good selection of teeth sizes . 
the lid is the best part of the pot ensemble . 
the cheese came out light and fluffy wished i had had one earlier . 
another thing i really like is that it does not have rivets . 
disappointed as i expected to received candy that would last a long time . 
easy to apply and it works very well . 
it is not difficult to clean or assemble . 
my wife despises window fans usually and she loves this thing too . 
i have read reviews from wine experts that it doesn t work . 
short blades and longer handles give you the leverage you need for tough cutting . 
no need to find storage place because it fits in any shallow drawer . 
we purchased this so our daughter could have fun toy to play with . 
we often cook sausages ,  hot dogs and hamburgers in it as well . 
belt works fine and installed in just a few minutes . 
i figured this would be a great alternative to use during the six weeks . 
too small and not the quality i expected . 
i bought this skillet for steaks and fried potatoes  , and fried eggs . 
very well designed and easy to figure out . 
i used the product for five days straight before running out . 
it might work for all purpose flour ,  which has less gluten . 
i hated the color that was sent to me ,  pale chalky beige . 
i had a less powerful one for num_num years before it finally gave out . 
i bought this for my num_num month old from santa for christmas . 
first ,  and surprising was that they have removeable sole inserts . 
i felt i must have missed something if the reviews were so good . 
it almost fit ,  but not enough to snap completely together and fit . 
am very disappointed that i still can t wear my shoes !  . 
i ve been through so many of these ineffective silly things . 
this is honestly the only case i ve thrown away in the garbage . 
still it is a fun learning experience and so far so good . 
generally if a toy makes noise ,  i don t mind so much . 
doesn t really reduce the fat anymore than most cooking methods . 
i bought this toy for my boys a few years back . 
look up videos on swype if you want to see it in action . 
can t imagine how it acts when you heat style your hair . 
it can t be tightened at that point to fix it . 
it was just one and that s not a big deal . 
it grinds it to a powder in just a couple of seconds . 
but the back side looks nice as well . 
i ordered two of them and both arrived within a week . 
i had two problems ,  one caused the rating to num_num num_extend
it seems to be of very good quality in its build . 
it s not overpowering ,  it is not like perfume . 
i of course treated it with a wood sealant to last through the winter . 
first of all ,  this will void whatever warranty you have with microsoft . 
my little girl wanted this for her birthday ,  so we got it . 
i also prefered the blade weight and thickness of the wustof . 
unless you have very small or very large hands it is comfortable to use . 
it had a great cost and a great product . 
i also tried a cheaper brand of slip on rubber broad heads . 
i ve come to the conclusion that i ve wasted my money . 
first of all i m not some raging halo . 
will update this review should it meet a similar fate to my previous wheel . 
after that you have to pay a subscription . 
it takes several passes through some types of hair to cut it . 
shame on what otherwise has been a reliable company with several other respectful products . 
after four days of that ,  i gave up and chucked it . 
the did not a aborb water at all . 
i guess it fails in the truth department on its advertising . 
the original unreal tournament is the very definition of fun . 
trying to slide to a different screen instantly turns it back off . 
it does this to a very significant degree and is extremely uncomfortable to wear . 
however ,  i feel civilization iv is most definitely not an improvement overall . 
you ve probably seen them use it on iron chef . 
spent more time fiddling with this than i did looking at the road . 
i only ordered on here because they were alot cheaper . 
i have been using this grill for num_num years . 
that is sufficiently minor as to not affect my rating . 
but it didn t do anything for my face . 
all of them are utter garbage ,  not even decent polyester . 
for the size ,  weight and price it is really worth it . 
if you are stir frying your ingredients  i . e . 
i say this as a guy with fairly thin wrists too . 
my husband said it was obvious so i had to return it . 
the radtach procable num_num inch dock extender works only part way . 
in my experience ,  they are a constant source of problems . 
put num_num quart of water into the machine . 
we re too stupid to put together normal sounding sentences . 
only issue is the blue light it becomes a annoying after a while . 
there is no warming plate in the unit but it doesn t need one . 
i have had mine for almost two years and they have not frayed . 
these small cookie scoops made perfectly uniform two inch cookies . 
this is not worth the money and the brand name is misleading . 
more creative than num_extend dont think so !  but still a great product . 
that does not hold true for this product . 
get it ,  it s worth the price for sure . 
this is due to the short lived cheaper lasers they put in them . 
a definite num_extend for how they handled this . 
the knife got a tad rusty after running it through a cycle . 
spyro games always used to be fun ,  but that tradition ends here . 
i have num_num bird feeders hanging from poles in my front and back yard . 
i followed the guidance and am grateful for it . 
this salad spinner is durable and easy to use . 
im thinking num_num gem stones in at least a num_num inch wheel . 
with sliced cheese in lieu of french bread on a fruit and cheese plate . 
the problem with the acrylic ones i ve found is the tipping factor . 
this offers really good protection for the phone . 
i finally made he purchase and am glad i did . 
i have both a square and round pan i use this with . 
i was also very disappointed at how quickly it drains the batteries . 
the aftertaste is so overpowering i had to brush my teeth . 
we both use the blackberry num_num curve ,  which each use bluetooth version num_extend
old grandson loves all things that have to do with construction . 
i imagine it will make soups even better than the old one as well . 
it charges my phone very quickly and to full % battery . 
great for about anything you want to shred ,  cut or mix . 
i bought them and find them pretty annoying . 
i can not send it back due to shipping requirements . 
it should reconnect easily when you are in the num_extend
so after two months of use ,  working in it . 
a process that takes a couple of minutes . 
i have dropped the phone onto a tile floor and it is fine . 
i put my kitchen appliances through the ringer . 
lasted for two games ,  during which i was the sole operator . 
multiplayer is just as bad ,  though thankfully not worse . 
it is so small . get a racket ball . pass this one by . 
and ,  there were many things we liked about this game . 
but these knives are well worth their price . 
the shipping charges are now lower and upfront on the order . 
this is one of the best vacuums i ve ever come across . 
it adds size o an already pretty big system . 
nothing bad to say about this wonderful innovation at all . 
pretty much all i ask for in a grinder . 
also ,  it creates more static than the one i m used to . 
overall i love them ,  and would probably buy them again . 
this one does the job i need it for !  . 
i paid $ for this when i bought a few other pieces . 
i just received a replacement bb curve from verizon . 
please reply with the filter part number and your location . 
i will never buy hamilton beach products again . 
love it !  really handy to set by the stove . 
i couldn t stand the persistent smell of feces in my apartment . 
of course the german s call this sort of idea good engineering . 
i bought this product for feeding my num_num persian cats while on vacation . 
one major complaint is the micromanagment of collecting  shards  . 
i have smaller bt headsets that last num_num hours longer . 
i ve been happy with most oxo products i ve purchased .

i started using xlear nasal spray a few years ago . 
amazon does not provide enough information about this press .

i am only giving this item num_num stars because of the absurd price . 
it looks like i ve splashed glitter all over my face . 
i still have privacy screen ,  after num_num months . 
but this stuff will fall apart after only a few washings . 
i just flipped the pan over ,  and there they were . 
i love that it uses natural ingredients but it was ineffective on my skin . 
for the price tag ,  its nothing to rave about . 
also it gets very hot while plugged in ,  which freaked me out . 
comes with a  towel  to clean the phone before placement . 
perhaps it won t rust ,  but upclose it looks a little cheesey . 
easy to put on and i have no problems . 
much better than block and tackle type hooks to store overhead . 
the remaining sticker is attached to the second film . 
it is hard to go to anything else now that i have used this . 
the whole thing gets hot when you use it . 
the buttons to extend the arms worked exactly one time before breaking . 
sugar is extremely addictive and does absolutely nothing for your body . 
i thought this was the hard plastic screen cover and it isn t . 
i loved the food for my cats as you can read below . 
there was nothing at all to indicate that belkin manufactured this item . 
what a ripoff !  learn from my mistake ,  do not buy . 
soe decided to push it to live a whole num_num weeks sooner than that . 
it was almost like pokemon yellow in the fighting system . 
the shape of the grains makes all the difference . 
i won t be buying from this vender ever again . 
i ve only charged it once since i bought it . 
it is great if you have more than one guest to serve . 
gave it to someone named happy on her birthday . 
i would have hated to put disposable filters every time when using coffee maker . 
both english and metric measurements are embossed onto each spoon . 
does not give me any confidence in buying any of the discovery kids toys . 
i did not have what i felt were unrealistic expectations of this device . 
if you want a cheaper sub deal with companies that specialize in that category . 
its very similar to that type of style . 
i purchased this filter for a braun num_extend coffeemaker . 
so i purchased another knife sharpener for this our num_num yankee swap . 
it scrolls way too easily and way too smoothly . 
adds some bulk to phone but not a large amount . 
i bought the lowest priced model more to test the brand than anything else . 
first ,  there is nothing about this to really write home about . 
i woke up with basically an oil slick on my face . 
this ring looked beautiful on out of the box . 
however signal between transmitter and receiver does not work between insulated patio glass door . 
it turned out just fine to replace what i had lost . 
i am actually afraid to open the remaining jars . 
note that i got mine from an amazon store called  small appliance  . 
it s not as bulky feel as the other cases available . 
a little at first ,  more with each successive try . 
we have tried a few recipes and had fun with them . 
i d suggest anyone looking to purchase linksys products look into netgear instead . 
over and over  and over and over  again . 
i put it together to surprise my husband . 
i think the sensor is reading carpet fibers its sucking up as dirt . 
i have a  made in usa  version of this . 
mediocre results until hitting upon a great cookbook . 
i run it outside the window and connect it to a garden hose . 
washing it is a breeze and just takes a second . 
i had to get some from the phone store . 
i spent $ for the num_extend and overall it was not worth the cost . 
on the other hand for power grating you ve got something here . 
anyway i recommend this one for its price and quality . 
did nt have time to return it before christmas so bought another necklass . 
thought ,  hey why not try something different might work . 
they have a medium pile lining that has more of a stiffer polyester feel . 
i use it charge my batteries since my usb port is not an option . 
exactly what i need for my phone and at the best price possible . 
it works with all types ,  but works best with roma tomatoes . 
it doesn t require genius to get this unit operating . 
the flap also is good and does not come loose at all . 
with grandchildren ,  this is the perfect combination of colorful and functional . 
two reviewers determined there are drivers to be downloaded but i was unsuccessful . 
synching is simple ,  with no passwords or codes required . 
the feel of the wheel is nice and i like the side scrolling feature . 
its like that showtime rotisserrie oven ,  you set it and forget it . 
i m tired of cheaply made ,  high priced appliances . 
bento spoon and the boker knife which is quite nice . 
there s no way this will last as long as claimed . 
fill the pan half way with water ,  and put it to boil . 
i have been missing out !  this thing is so sharp . 
i haven t had any problems with teflon flaking off . 
i also like the adjustable heat option for the warming plate . 
ridiculous !  i had trouble getting it on with zero bubbles . 
so please stop buying this and maybe they will lower the price . 
loved the deffender case hated the apple phone . 
so far i am not at all happy . 
they send you num_num because each one lasts about two days . 
i would recommend this case to my friends . 
just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake . 
for the price ,  this is a good buy . 
the constriction on my dog caused him to sit . 
either than or the developers decided to do their own . 
company will exchange though but it wastes your time doing this . 
it s this second part that really grosses me out . 
its good that its made in canada rather than china . 
fair price . x x x x x x x x xx x . 
i didn t have enough of them to return . 
also ,  the knife is easy to maneuver despite its length . 
i would not recomend this for a tmobile ,  mytouch phone to anyone . 
much to my dismay ,  the invisishield was nothing but garbage . 
so shipping takes a while but it is definitely worth the price . 
i love cooking and you need sharp knives when cooking . 
i can carry it in my pocket and use it when i need to . 
first ,  without the extension they are very short . 
i wore this product today for a few hours today . 
i agree with the others that this was tough to open . 
i have to say that it was money well spent . 
yes ,  they are light ,  and are not durable at all . 
audio isn t a religion and these are not holy water . 
i dumped all num_num screen protectors in the trash bin . 
the bottom most container is not as small as one would think . 
marineland does a very good job with their led aquarium systems . 
i cannot wait to show it off ! thank you !  . 
the directions were easy to follow but the quality of the easel was pathetic . 
i ve had many lighters and this one might be the best . 
as stated by the many reviews ,  this is an exceptinal carpet cleaner . 
i miss my days of cracker eating before becoming gluten free . 
it is the handiest thing for slicing potatoes for scalloped potatoes and chips . 
once it dies i will purchase a better unit . 
i m starting to hate it because i don t need to upgrade . 
this machine is no match for the new consoles . 
i found these patches very hard to put on . 
i love my lodge omelet pan and use it almost every morning . 
we love that it can go straight from the stove top to the oven . 
unfortunately this product did not do much for me . 
it is worse then no lube because it gets soooo sticky . 
it makes it easy and neat to store and access all of your scarves . 
the complication is the heft of the phone . 
it was not as good as our much cheaper model . 
wow im impressed with this device !  how useful it is . 
other reviews seemed more positive ,  but i just gave mine away . 
if you want loud get the cdn num_extend count down big digit timer . 
i ordered these from amazon since i could find them nowhere in my area . 
this case is far from what i expected . 
i thought that all of the possibilities would be awesome . 
the bottom part is stretching after only a month of owning the case . 
nevertheless ,  the smell lasts for num_num or num_num minutes tops . 
my dog has started to become anxious at bedtime . 
i hope it will be a better choice . 
i can use a creamy concealer on it . 
when you place the eye brow attachment on you can get a mixed cut . 
it could be that i live in an apartment with hills and trees around . 
we use these alot and they work great . 
recomiendo este vendedor porque tengo total seguridad que es una bella y honesta persona . 
not that we should of had to do that . 
this cover does exactly what it is designed to do . 
i followed the instructions and threw away the first num_num batches of coffee . 
it s very simple and takes up very little space on the pot rack . 
white in the refrigerator a couple of days longer . 
these wine stoppers are very inexpensive and certainly do the job . 
hand graters can be a mess to clean ,  especially under the handle . 
the box is very shallow and not easily covered securely . 
i bought this is a gift for my brother . 
in that short time ,  he ripped one wing off the toy . 
i ve used it once and i won t be using it again . 
oh ,  and the battery life is pretty decent . 
the wheel oftenly stuck and wont turn on its rail . 
it hasn t done anything for his thin coat though . 
if you need a pot with this capacity num_extend qts  buy this one . 
so not that great for leaving on at night . 
this case looks nice but that s about it . 
i would never recommend this terrible waste of money case . 
i was not at all pleased with the performance of this chopper . 
great case ,  easy to use and very durable . 
i expected an improvement in signal strength from my tiny usb direct plugin type . 
while the mascara is soft ,  it is not full . 
i m sure it depends on your age and body type . 
i have not been able to stop using it . 
overall it is inconvenient to keep the counter and the unit clean . 
i contacted the company and they said that the shipment had been lost . 
the graphics are most definitely improved over the previous version . 
like i said ,  it works ,  these are ok . 
then she said  well you ordered the pu which is what you got . 
unfortunately i m not sure what all the five star reviews are for . 
it s probably my phone but it happens constantly since i got the battery . 
the daily challenge around here is keeping the cat fur to a minimum . 
these make great little night lights for the kids . 
went looking for them and you had them . 
i ve not been terribly impressed with this box . 
it s still going great ,  i just needed more capacity . 
and after all that ,  the base broke too . 
one thing is the amazingly poor unit a . i . 
too bulky and there are better products out there in single units . 
open carefully and handle the zippers with care . 
i was bored after the first num_num minutes . 
this cream will give you acne if you have sensitive skin . 
i can t remember when i first bought this timer . 
i ve used these a few times and broke them very easily . 
great headset ,  solid build quality and blocks out the wind . 
i contacted the seller and was given a refund . 
you can probably run them over with your car and still be okay . 
the finer the setting ,  the longer it takes . 
i did some research ,  and went with this one . 
in num_num thq came out with this wrestling game . 
because it s made of cast iron ,  scorching is minimized . 
i would not recommend this item for dogs who chew . 
the material that it is made of is like a dirt magnet . 
i had high hopes for this product since i bruise easily . 
quite tasteless and they make you order so many . 
it stays on and i unplug it when it s done . 
i purchased them and when they arrived they were torn . 
i do seem to need to invest in some better popcorn . 
other than that small problem ,  this is a great bt headdest . 
i m a male ,  a bachelor who lives alone . 
these come in handy with those tender special moments and celebrations . 
i bought this set for our toaster oven . 
the aluminum ones get stained and ugly after a few uses . 
they get into the corners as described and are flexible yet firm . 
all came well sharpened and ready to go . 
this game gives you no incentive to keep playing . 
i ordered it and it was delivered well in time . 
anker is a fine product though i d never heard of it . 
i threw it out because i can t take alcohol . 
i got this for my num_num month old daughter for christmas . 
in particular ,  the coating on this cookware has been cheapened . 
so i just thought maybe it ll help keep my acne away . 
also these attachment pieces are very easy to clean . 
i purchased the screen protectors for my evo . 
it it pretty hardy ,  i haven t broken it yet . 
i don t see what others have liked about this . 
i estimate that four trips were made to empty and refill the water compartments . 
one corner is slightly taller than the other but its hardly noticeable . 
well worth the money ,  wouldn t want to be without it . 
i cannot recommend this product for anyone trying to fix a leaky transmission . 
this just doesn t have enough power to massage my shoulders and neck . 
blocking the red hot coils from my cookie sheets ,  and glassware . 
i had it professionally installed at a local bike shop . 
worked best on older new england house with narrow staircase . 
it crashed for no reason ,  saves got corrupted . 
we have been treating our hair for months and finally got this . 
saves on cleaning and the use of aluminum foil . 
another  energy  product that simply wastes our money . 
it keeps the air clean and nice fresh smelling . 
i think that is the way to keep the fish moist . 
this is a fantastic idea ,  however it has some flaws . 
we plugged in an extra headset laying around the house . 
this little butter bell is a fantastic buy . 
this pan is a bit heavier and truly nonstick . 
drinking the coffee was slightly less unpleasent than the smell suggested it would be . 
one minute per slice seems like a good rule of thumb so far . 
the price was good ,  and came quickly though my prime membership . 
i would not even give my current one away . 
i ve tried the pulls with prongs that go along side the cork . 
i use this with afresh to clean my cook top . 
then both of them go into the dishwasher . 
i purchased this jawbone hd as a replacement for an older jawbone thinker . 
i love cheetos and any artificially or naturally enhanced cheese snack . 
then into my phone and it chargers my phone . 
the loops stop any accidently lost or intentional disappearance . 
whatever the case ,  i couldn t be more unhappy with this purchase . 
this unit makes the best french fries i ve ever made . 
so i guess it s really a matter of preference . 
things i notice so far : + bluetooth num_extend streaming is solid . 
mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary . 
that said ,  the mic did pic up everything it could . 
just spend the extra bucks and buy an official one from apple . 
i will add an update if i ever figure it out . 
really confused ppl riding with me at first . 
i have had two of these cans outside for over a year . 
went to the second one using the same method ,  no go . 
i just got this and recently got a chance to use it . 
cheap ,  low quality chicom scope with even cheaper ring mounts . 
heavy ,  patterned glass ,  and very classy looking on the table . 
does this ever happen to the cpu ?  rarely . 
auto shut off after num_num hours ,  which is a good feature . 
i m a fan of symbian and find it easy to operate . 
this is a good hoodie and well made . 
my mouth feels very dry and i am thirsty after drinking this . 
very good price but this one harder to use than my cusinart . 
i would not suggest this on black iphones . 
and it s much much cheaper than getting it at the cusinart parts site . 
despite the port breaking it gets num_extend stars . 
voice command is better on this set than other ones i ve tried . 
i have several of these ,  well worth it . 
will break in over time though ,  it s rubber . 
i won t be buying any more in the future . 
i think that dsp manager is the stock one for android phones . 
the unit itself rests like a necklace around your neck . 
i m convinced vacuum sealing works just as advertised . 
instead i would recommend cetaphil gentle cleanser and you will be fine . 
now i just need to buy a catch can for the bottle tops . 
it s too bad because they look like they would keep my ears warm . 
the case fit okay but not attractive at all . 
recently threw in the trash as the line wore out . 
she handed it back to me and picked up her ginsu knife . 
i can t believe how beautiful and substantial this ice cream maker is . 
the only thing is it stretches easily so be careful with that . 
maybe a num_extend old girl could wear it . 
you get what you pay for i guess . 
there are num_num blue lights to indicate the level of the unit s charge . 
fasy to keep clean and a real treasure . 
it is a poor performer when it comes to odor retention and clumping . 
i use it a lot ,  and it never gave me any problem . 
just do your homework and you will end up pretty satisfied . 
i ordered num_num and find this to be a hugh mistake . 
i purchased this based on rave reviews from others . 
it would have been perfect if it was a tad bit smaller . 
flavor :  it has some tangy notes ,  and overall not bad . 
i liked this and was happy with my purchase . 
i ll stick to my xbox for now ,  thanks . 
this will compete with any top of the line knife you can buy . 
games like gem journey are easier to play with a stylus like this . 
i sprinkle a little flour on the rolls before stamping to prevent sticking . 
every product i own from them has failed or been a letdown . 
only negative was delifery was num_num days late . 
it s also a good size for a family of num_extend
i recently purchased  white rice  popcorn for my dad who has diverticulitious . 
certainly one of the more widely produced in the us . 
other brands in this large of a container are glass . 
i would buy again if the shipping wasnt so long . 
waste of money ,  waste of time ,  waste of blood . 
once you play one match ,  you ve played them all . 
both rub my dog raw and cause bleeding . 
it works as advertised so i m happy !   :   . 
i would suggest a more tropical flavor with chilled water .

i ve used it twice and it has stopped working . 
these salmons are in water not vegetable oil . 
i adjusted the volumes on the ipod and the cassette player . 
my dish feels very solid to the touch . 
trash cans are pretty unexciting ,  but this one is awfully nice . 
returned product but from what i ve heard it does the job . 
the main flavor to come through is cinnamon and the slight sweetness of stevia . 
he read every amazon . com review as well as the zojirushi website . 
and it s a bread knife and nothing all that special . 
i must find a way to return them . 
the voice from the earpiece says  connected  on successful completion . 
order it with something else ,  and you ll get free shipping . 
basically ,  this product is a ripoff on consumers . 
the charging light illuminates ,  but does not charge . 
i had it a long time now and i still love it . 
he s heavy and stable enough to not tip over when it s windy . 
once the charger is removed ,  the phone starts working ,  again .

but this one does the job very nicely . 
durable and seems similar quality to apple products . 
i would not trust anything bigger than iphone num_extend
shipped free directly from realook and arrived within two days . 
i received the wrong color and it shreds easily . 
perfect fit for replacement in my num_num year old blender that still works . 
hardly something i would give as a wrapped birthday gift . 
the quality of materials and workmanship is noticeably less . 
this is a worthless item that makes no sense at all . 
and yet it is compact and not too heavy . 
i have had no problem with either piece and highly recommend the products . 
first things first ,  make sure you are ordering the right headset . 
it not educational or exciting and it s annoying . 
it worked for maybe num_num months then died . 
it was just what i expected it to be .

i have owned it for two years and it is a work horse . 
the glass cuisinart lids would pour water everywhere in a wet mess . 
once the lid closes ,  the smell goes away .

this case is cute however the is the only good thing about it . 
this is what s affordable right now ,  so it has to do . 
then i thought something was wrong with my car .

save yourself some time and money and skip this product . 
i have to lower the rating another notch . 
either you will like it ,  or you won t . 
great charger ,  though there may be cheaper options . 
the description on the website did not state that the straps were elastic . 
but for now ,  i m quite happy with this . 
this game offers nothing unique and the graphics are not worth raving about . 
this cuts down on waste and you don t have to ingest harmful propellants . 
overall we will not be purchasing this product again .

these are supposedly cotton ,  but they don t feel like it .

i like neutrogena products as a rule ,  so this was a disappointment . 
i used to use a good cooks brand safety opener and really liked it .

the jawbone may perform admirably as far as technology . 
they pile up nice in the closet and clean up great in the dishwasher . 
the real thing is nong shim shin noodle ramyun . 
we use a bread machine to prepare the dough and provide the first rise . 
maybe it just needs broken in and some fine fitting . 
a gas cooktop would be worse and a smooth cooktop probably much better . 
it reminds me more of silly putty than of a concealer .

it didn t have the smell a lot complained of though . 
i would definitely recommend this for a cute case . 
yes ,  it is plastic ,  but not cheap plastic . 
this product was not in functioning condition when delivered . 
i think i will return and stick with wool gloves . 
not that anything sticks that much you just don t have to worry . 
the bar contains  agave nectar  which does not occur naturally .

all the songs build on the same words . 
the waist cords are over a foot long after being taken in . 
replaced my pampered chef garlic press with this one . 
it is close to the old one i had for years . 
simple !  does the job it was intended for . 
two days later i no longer saw them anywhere on the building . 
the cookbook that comes with it is adequate . 
plus its from amazon and amazon wouldn t put their name on crap . 
this gets the job done for the price . 
might work for others ,  didn t work for me . 
so far has lasted for a long time and does not wear off . 
have been using it daily since it arrived . 
i purchased two to mount horizontally under the shelves of my kitchen island .

i bought this protective cover case for num_num cents plus shipping . 
cleans up nice and cooks waffles in a reasonable amount of time . 
really ,  it all does look nice graphically wise . 
i would have given a five star if the packaging with some bubble wrap . 
i will never have a phone without an otterbox again . 
a must have if you have one of the older foodsavers . 
the concept was great and it worked very well when it worked . 
it worked great for the first couple of weeks then it just stopped completely . 
this meter is technology from a decade ago . 
no battery to wear out and have to replace .
