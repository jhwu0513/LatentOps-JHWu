0	this is honestly the only case i ve thrown away in the garbage .
0	shame on what otherwise has been a reliable company with several other respectful products .
0	it s like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends .
0	it was supposed to be a complete toy .
0	so i guess it s really a matter of preference .
0	this case is far from what i expected .
0	obviously we all have our own preferences for taste .
0	the cables seem rather basic and work well ,  except one problem .
0	i am actually afraid to open the remaining jars .
0	these make great little night lights for the kids .
0	i don t see what others have liked about this .
0	the directions were easy to follow but the quality of the easel was pathetic .
0	there was almost nothing i liked about this product .
0	this just doesn t have enough power to massage my shoulders and neck .
0	two days later i no longer saw them anywhere on the building .
0	we re too stupid to put together normal sounding sentences .
0	amazon was good to give me a refund right away .
0	after four days of that ,  i gave up and chucked it .
0	it worked for maybe num_num months then died .
0	i used this along with another similar product ,  for over num_num months .
0	i guess it fails in the truth department on its advertising .
0	the shape of the grains makes all the difference .
0	i woke up with basically an oil slick on my face .
0	i also tried a cheaper brand of slip on rubber broad heads .
0	it was all potatoes and had very little clam flavor .
0	i do not like this belt because of lack of material .
0	don t waste your time or money on these jeans .
0	they also make noise if you happen to touch one against the other .
0	i m sure it depends on your age and body type .
0	worse ,  the controls are so confusing that it gives me a headache .
0	these are supposedly cotton ,  but they don t feel like it .
0	my husband said it was obvious so i had to return it .
0	he enjoys this toy ,  but can get the treats out fairly quickly .
0	i simply treated it how i would assume a curling iron works .
0	i ve not been terribly impressed with this box .
0	hardly something i would give as a wrapped birthday gift .
0	i won t give this to the new puppy i m getting .
0	spent more time fiddling with this than i did looking at the road .
0	multiplayer is just as bad ,  though thankfully not worse .
0	this one sits on our shelf collecting dust .
0	if your bike had a kickstand on the plate it won t lock down .
0	might work for others ,  didn t work for me .
0	just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake .
0	the bowl is too light  we even had it on a rubber mat .
0	in num_num thq came out with this wrestling game .
0	i don t know why it has all the good reviews .
0	this game offers nothing unique and the graphics are not worth raving about .
0	there s no way this will last as long as claimed .
0	does not give me any confidence in buying any of the discovery kids toys .
0	after that you have to pay a subscription .
0	i ordered these from amazon since i could find them nowhere in my area .
0	other brands in this large of a container are glass .
0	another  energy  product that simply wastes our money .
0	generally if a toy makes noise ,  i don t mind so much .
0	it reminds me more of silly putty than of a concealer .
0	so after two months of use ,  working in it .
0	this is just a little too low quality .
0	then contact sharp and go on from there .
0	most products are for dandruff caused by dry scalp .
0	the concept was great and it worked very well when it worked .
0	the graphics are most definitely improved over the previous version .
0	a little at first ,  more with each successive try .
0	unfortunately i m not sure what all the five star reviews are for .
0	i will add an update if i ever figure it out .
0	it not educational or exciting and it s annoying .
0	if you get these just be a bit careful .
0	unfortunately this product did not do much for me .
0	speedloader is very hard to use especially with an extended magazine .
0	i purchased this jawbone hd as a replacement for an older jawbone thinker .
0	also ,  it creates more static than the one i m used to .
0	the buttons to extend the arms worked exactly one time before breaking .
0	i ve been through so many of these ineffective silly things .
0	and after all that ,  the base broke too .
0	i would suggest a more tropical flavor with chilled water .
0	because it is definitely not worth full price .
0	a process that takes a couple of minutes .
0	there is no menu selection for find free books .
0	avoid the heartache and wasted titme of bad discs .
0	old grandson loves all things that have to do with construction .
0	when i contacted the company the response was that they shipped it .
0	you dont get so much sand with this .
0	we have been treating our hair for months and finally got this .
0	surely not worth what was paid for it by half .
0	i spent $ for the num_extend and overall it was not worth the cost .
0	i then emptied th coffee grinder and looked for an obstruction ,  none .
0	and ,  there were many things we liked about this game .
0	i have num_num bird feeders hanging from poles in my front and back yard .
0	very well designed and easy to figure out .
0	i had high hopes for this product since i bruise easily .
0	the did not a aborb water at all .
0	the radtach procable num_num inch dock extender works only part way .
0	they are thinner and retain memory than the older ones .
0	the product is not durable but it might just be the one i received .
0	for some reason it worked out terribly for me .
0	that does not hold true for this product .
0	this is a worthless item that makes no sense at all .
0	since that time i have replaced the game .
0	when you place the eye brow attachment on you can get a mixed cut .
0	i agree with the others that this was tough to open .
0	armada lacks the epic scope of similar games like homeworld or even starcraft .
0	will break in over time though ,  it s rubber .
0	the quality is declined quickly by heat exposure .
0	i had to get some from the phone store .
0	also it gets very hot while plugged in ,  which freaked me out .
0	its good that its made in canada rather than china .
0	and still the focus was extremely soft or just plain terrible .
0	birds or squirrels . tried num_num different kinds of bird food .
0	i put in a password but router won t recoginize it .
0	i think i will return and stick with wool gloves .
0	overall it is inconvenient to keep the counter and the unit clean .
0	it took three years three vets and over twelve hundred dollars spent before success .
0	it takes several passes through some types of hair to cut it .
0	the case fit okay but not attractive at all .
0	if you can afford it step up to something that will last .
0	these salmons are in water not vegetable oil .
0	in this case ,  it s a big disappointment for num_extend
0	i did not buy from a num_extend party seller .
0	after all the great reviews i thought i d give this a try .
0	i can not send it back due to shipping requirements .
0	not to mention it did not fit my screen completely .
0	did nt have time to return it before christmas so bought another necklass .
0	however ,  definitely does not work like a new battery .
0	good that they are from usa and not china !  .
0	and theres no warning on any of these cans that i can identify .
0	the wheel oftenly stuck and wont turn on its rail .
0	bought this for use to hold my droid incredible .
0	good thing filters for num_num gallon tanks are cheap .
0	i can use a creamy concealer on it .
0	the lid is the best part of the pot ensemble .
0	its tollable but thats not the best thing to say about headphones .
0	audio isn t a religion and these are not holy water .
0	this is called cheating !  i expected canister with fuel at least .
0	it could be that i live in an apartment with hills and trees around .
0	this is the worst game i have come across in a long time .
0	it is a poor performer when it comes to odor retention and clumping .
0	nightwolf s friendship is cool too where he juggles his hammers .
0	i bought this product for feeding my num_num persian cats while on vacation .
0	very hard plastic and not that fun to play with at all .
0	this cream will give you acne if you have sensitive skin .
0	i bought this for my num_num month old from santa for christmas .
0	otherwise ,  they fall off your head at the slightest lean or tilt .
0	i would not buy anything else from this vendor .
0	they were huge ,  yet the same size in the leather is tight .
0	drinking the coffee was slightly less unpleasent than the smell suggested it would be .
0	the charging light illuminates ,  but does not charge .
0	i found these patches very hard to put on .
0	they pee in it about once a week ,  if that .
0	this ring looked beautiful on out of the box .
0	mind you the oem xoom charger is not like that at all .
0	ekobrew ,  the coffee always stays in that bottom wedge section .
0	i would never recommend this terrible waste of money case .
0	like showdown : legends of wrestling , it has too many glitches to count .
0	also the  free will  option is an absolute joke .
0	as the clock clicked by num_extend i still felt sluggish .
0	i bought this skillet for steaks and fried potatoes  , and fried eggs .
0	it is best to invest in a good set of makeup brushes .
0	this is a fantastic idea ,  however it has some flaws .
0	first ,  without the extension they are very short .
0	flavor :  it has some tangy notes ,  and overall not bad .
0	i also have to hold the headphone cord to keep it from flapping around .
0	if you are sensitive to maltodextrin ,  this isn t for you .
0	it worked great for the first couple of weeks then it just stopped completely .
0	i would not even give my current one away .
0	then i put the cream on my feet especially around my toes and heels .
0	it really is like they didn t take anything at all .
0	it makes an annoying sound when it is on .
0	what a ripoff !  learn from my mistake ,  do not buy .
0	i have no padding of my own to offset hard soles .
0	the bar contains  agave nectar  which does not occur naturally .
0	most operations there is a noticable delay lag of num_extend to num_num seconds .
0	trying to slide to a different screen instantly turns it back off .
0	soe decided to push it to live a whole num_num weeks sooner than that .
0	all of them are utter garbage ,  not even decent polyester .
0	can t imagine how it acts when you heat style your hair .
0	i would not recommend this item for dogs who chew .
0	try explaining to a two year old why her tattoo keeps  breaking  .
0	the main flavor to come through is cinnamon and the slight sweetness of stevia .
0	this product was not in functioning condition when delivered .
0	there were other vegetables included ,  but you really couldn t taste them .
0	and i wanted them all to be easy to access .
0	claritin used to be the best thing around .
0	note that i got mine from an amazon store called  small appliance  .
0	i contacted the seller and was given a refund .
0	the good pieces that i manages to salvage the birds refuse to touch .
0	over and over  and over and over  again .
0	she handed it back to me and picked up her ginsu knife .
0	maybe a num_extend old girl could wear it .
0	hopefully you won t have to go through this nonsense .
0	after a num_extend try i received the same product .
0	you can go to any chain store and do better .
0	i guess maybe there are some people that this product could help .
0	first ,  i put them both under my tongue simultaneously .
0	waste of money ,  waste of time ,  waste of blood .
0	first of all ,  syrup shouldn t run ,  it should ooze .
0	we purchased this so our daughter could have fun toy to play with .
0	it s this second part that really grosses me out .
0	this item does not provide full coverage as the picture suggests .
0	you can probably run them over with your car and still be okay .
0	there are companies that make dog biscuits with the activated charcoal in it .
0	first of all ,  this will void whatever warranty you have with microsoft .
0	do not buy . i didn t expect much because of the cost .
0	i m just looking forward to the day i get to replace it .
0	all the songs build on the same words .
0	i ll just stick with a good mayo and skip the bacon .
0	lasted for two games ,  during which i was the sole operator .
0	num_extend has much better graphics ,  better sound ,  slightly better control .
0	hasn t had to be rebooted yet due to connection issues .
0	i was not at all pleased with the performance of this chopper .
0	whatever the case ,  i couldn t be more unhappy with this purchase .
0	the balm is crap more like a vaseline stick .
0	th product features and editorial review spell germany as the origin of manufacture .
0	there must be an engineering issue with the motor of the toy .
0	cheap ,  low quality chicom scope with even cheaper ring mounts .
0	not a good product for conditioning even though it says it has shea butter .
0	enfamil infant is characterized by choline and dha .
0	it is too bad because the ingredients looked to be quality .
0	$ is too much to pay for a $ cable .
0	the entire thing fits in the palm of my child s hand .
0	first ,  there is nothing about this to really write home about .
0	i have a  made in usa  version of this .
0	quite tasteless and they make you order so many .
0	the first time through ,  things really slowed down around level num_extend
0	i have been using it twice a day since i received it .
0	i thought i was over charged once it was returned .
0	first things first ,  make sure you are ordering the right headset .
0	i figured this would be a great alternative to use during the six weeks .
0	worked best on older new england house with narrow staircase .
0	hello;i purchased this item from a major retailer about num_num years ago .
0	i m tired of cheaply made ,  high priced appliances .
0	i ordered two of them and both arrived within a week .
0	i might return it ,  but i need a can opener .
0	the transmit strength on this compact num_extend is pretty strong .
0	it hasn t done anything for his thin coat though .
0	it is so small . get a racket ball . pass this one by .
0	my mouth feels very dry and i am thirsty after drinking this .
0	gave it to someone named happy on her birthday .
0	it opens cans ok ,  but no better than the old fashioned openers .
0	if you want a cheaper sub deal with companies that specialize in that category .
0	other reviews seemed more positive ,  but i just gave mine away .
0	i purchased this based on rave reviews from others .
0	they would flip off or get hung up due to poorly rolling wheels .
0	i received the wrong color and it shreds easily .
0	might have been nice ,  but just went over my cheeks .
0	i won t be buying any more in the future .
0	certainly one of the more widely produced in the us .
0	not that we should of had to do that .
0	we ve tried num_num of these waffle makers since jan num_extend
0	i tried everything short of breaking the thing open .
0	spend the extra bucks and get the chopat knee bands .
0	it works for maybe a few minutes and wears off quickly .
0	i bought them and find them pretty annoying .
0	unfortunately ,  not my blackberry nor my cell phone .
0	the box is very shallow and not easily covered securely .
0	i like neutrogena products as a rule ,  so this was a disappointment .
0	don t buy this unless you like replacing toasters .
0	that is right up until one day the record feature stopped working .
0	i thought the concept was good; scuffy thinks otherwise .
0	both rub my dog raw and cause bleeding .
0	nokia knows how to design a very good interface .
0	it didn t work for me hopefully other people will have better luck .
0	the waist cords are over a foot long after being taken in .
0	overall we will not be purchasing this product again .
0	with sliced cheese in lieu of french bread on a fruit and cheese plate .
0	the pair made in mexico is much better .
0	once the charger is removed ,  the phone starts working ,  again .
0	that is not to say that these treats are bad by any means .
0	it might work for all purpose flour ,  which has less gluten .
0	i d rather be a little less healthy and a little more happy .
0	i love that it uses natural ingredients but it was ineffective on my skin .
0	i have to lower the rating another notch .
0	i love cheetos and any artificially or naturally enhanced cheese snack .
0	i felt i must have missed something if the reviews were so good .
0	i have purchased fairly cheap holders from motorola and they lasted a while .
0	the feel of the wheel is nice and i like the side scrolling feature .
0	got all excited ,  but this taste nohthing like honey at all .
0	i am only giving this item num_num stars because of the absurd price .
0	absolutely horrid; cheaper @ costco if you must .
0	taking it out of the box i found the design to be awkward .
0	i was bored after the first num_num minutes .
0	no comment on the strainer since i have not used it yet .
0	i dumped all num_num screen protectors in the trash bin .
0	disappointed as i expected to received candy that would last a long time .
0	i practically felt like i threw away my money on this one .
0	i contacted the company and they said that the shipment had been lost .
0	crayola makes the best crayons ,  don t get me wrong .
0	two reviewers determined there are drivers to be downloaded but i was unsuccessful .
0	this does not appear to attract more mosquitos than the light does by itself .
0	if you have soft facial fair then by all means use these razors .
0	for the price tag ,  its nothing to rave about .
0	it s not overpowering ,  it is not like perfume .
0	my first suggestion to anyone reading reviews on this product is to keep looking .
0	she could have decorated her carrying case herself .
0	the quality of materials and workmanship is noticeably less .
0	perhaps it won t rust ,  but upclose it looks a little cheesey .
0	i did some research ,  and went with this one .
0	company will exchange though but it wastes your time doing this .
0	you get what you pay for i guess .
0	because it s too big for my cup holder .
0	i bought this set for our toaster oven .
0	if you are grinding dry items ,  it should be ok .
0	i hate myself for falling for the james bond license and wasting $
0	first ,  and surprising was that they have removeable sole inserts .
0	i won t be buying from this vender ever again .
0	i would not recomend this for a tmobile ,  mytouch phone to anyone .
0	the real thing is nong shim shin noodle ramyun .
0	to ataris credit ,  this game was a bit fun .
0	camera fell of it after a few uses .
0	these definitely open up your nasal passages and functionally work as advertised .
0	i expected an improvement in signal strength from my tiny usb direct plugin type .
0	i adjusted the volumes on the ipod and the cassette player .
0	would suggest using one of the toy bubblers amazon sells .
0	and it is very possible that these are good cables .
0	i did not purchase my set from this vendor .
0	but it didn t do anything for my face .
0	nevertheless ,  the smell lasts for num_num or num_num minutes tops .
0	i bought this toy for my boys a few years back .
0	it s very black ,  and it does add volume .
0	this cord seemed like a deal and got good reviews .
0	so please stop buying this and maybe they will lower the price .
0	i didn t have the rust problems that others had .
0	thought ,  hey why not try something different might work .
0	the problem with the acrylic ones i ve found is the tipping factor .
0	my goof to not research this brand more .
0	i ve had many lighters and this one might be the best .
0	but this stuff will fall apart after only a few washings .
0	they send you num_num because each one lasts about two days .
0	with a couple of bucks you could make something a lot better yourself .
0	sugar is extremely addictive and does absolutely nothing for your body .
0	its very similar to that type of style .
0	they are cheerios ,  afterall ,  and we love the original kind .
0	i tried supergluing the magnets back on to no avail .
0	not the fastest but better than my other hot air brush .
0	so i bought this product hoping it would help to regulate my cycles .
0	the bottom part is stretching after only a month of owning the case .
0	first of all i m not some raging halo .
0	does increase volume but does not feel nice to the touch .
0	for me this was a most disappointing product .
0	would have been alot nicer if it simply threaded in with the correct alignment .
0	i ve used it once and i won t be using it again .
0	these run quite small even though they are stretchy .
0	i loved the food for my cats as you can read below .
0	i will always have slight pain ,  no matter what .
0	this is not at all expected from a respected brand like sony .
0	too bulky and there are better products out there in single units .
0	a definite num_extend for how they handled this .
0	i m selling mine to make room for something else .
0	one major complaint is the micromanagment of collecting  shards  .
0	the material that it is made of is like a dirt magnet .
0	i thought that all of the possibilities would be awesome .
0	i run it outside the window and connect it to a garden hose .
0	yes ,  they are light ,  and are not durable at all .
0	does this ever happen to the cpu ?  rarely .
0	marineland does a very good job with their led aquarium systems .
0	it didn t fit in my bathtub ,  which is a standard size .
0	every product i own from them has failed or been a letdown .
0	i was hoping for a bit better than this from amazon .
0	my dog has started to become anxious at bedtime .
0	my first draft of this review was also way too long .
0	i didn t have enough of them to return .
0	i will never again purchase another game where this is a requirement .
0	so ,  this car looks cool and all but its not that great .
0	i contacted q cell and they replaced the back cover .
0	spyro games always used to be fun ,  but that tradition ends here .
0	well it made it worse like a rubber band texture .
0	just reinstall the previous ghost recon and raven shield games .
0	it was almost like pokemon yellow in the fighting system .
0	i ve come to the conclusion that i ve wasted my money .
0	really ,  it all does look nice graphically wise .
0	i ordered num_num and find this to be a hugh mistake .
0	the aftertaste is so overpowering i had to brush my teeth .
0	this machine is no match for the new consoles .
0	this meter is technology from a decade ago .
0	i could feel some of the grains even after much shaking .
0	i miss my days of cracker eating before becoming gluten free .
0	i d rather tie a towel around my neck as a cape .
0	it does this to a very significant degree and is extremely uncomfortable to wear .
0	in that short time ,  he ripped one wing off the toy .
0	i got this for my num_num month old daughter for christmas .
0	it was not as good as our much cheaper model .
0	i started using xlear nasal spray a few years ago .
0	i hated the color that was sent to me ,  pale chalky beige .
0	i would not trust anything bigger than iphone num_extend
0	the constriction on my dog caused him to sit .
0	i tried hiding them in her food and in her treats .
0	it crashed for no reason ,  saves got corrupted .
0	do not buy this product ! the photos are horribly ,  horribly misleading .
0	just spend the extra bucks and buy an official one from apple .
0	plus ,  it s not very filling ,  even for rice .
0	i ve learned that companies make varying degrees of quality .
0	then she said  well you ordered the pu which is what you got .
0	too small and not the quality i expected .
0	i was looking forward to this game for a couple of num_extend
0	it just smears it around until the water evaporates into the air .
0	because these knives will greatly appreciate on the collector s market .
0	it didn t have the smell a lot complained of though .
0	in my experience ,  they are a constant source of problems .
0	either than or the developers decided to do their own .
0	like they glued it together and shipped it out it seemed .
0	it scrolls way too easily and way too smoothly .
0	i will still continue to use philosophy products ,  just not this one .
0	now i have a game that i don t ever want to play .
0	i threw it out because i can t take alcohol .
0	it makes a farce out of a good num_num num_extend
0	i couldn t stand the persistent smell of feces in my apartment .
0	after a few days i noticed i was unusually fatigued .
0	i must find a way to return them .
0	she didn t like the handle of this one at all .
0	i have no idea why this is a cult favorite .
0	my little girl wanted this for her birthday ,  so we got it .
0	so what it comes down to is that u get what u paid for .
0	one thing is the amazingly poor unit a . i .
0	my daughter used this for school for about num_num months until the strap broke .
0	returned product but from what i ve heard it does the job .
0	this game gives you no incentive to keep playing .
0	insert the micro usb to your phone and enjoy your widescreen display .
0	i would not buy this again in the future .
0	the cars that come with this garage are cute .
0	i ll stick to my xbox for now ,  thanks .
0	instead i would recommend cetaphil gentle cleanser and you will be fine .
0	of course in most sports games ,  graphics shouldn t matter .
0	it adds size o an already pretty big system .
0	i had it professionally installed at a local bike shop .
0	i cannot recommend this product for anyone trying to fix a leaky transmission .
0	the original unreal tournament is the very definition of fun .
0	however ,  i feel civilization iv is most definitely not an improvement overall .
0	the item was considerably different quality than pictured .
0	it is worse then no lube because it gets soooo sticky .
0	i thought this was the hard plastic screen cover and it isn t .
0	i was surprised as the box seemed to be in good shape .
0	i ve not had this happen with my wusthofs .
0	this is not worth the money and the brand name is misleading .
0	so i just thought maybe it ll help keep my acne away .
0	am very disappointed that i still can t wear my shoes !  .
0	ridiculous !  i had trouble getting it on with zero bubbles .
0	the inside of the case that contacts the phone is not smooth at all .
0	i purchased them and when they arrived they were torn .
0	while the mascara is soft ,  it is not full .
0	i will never buy hamilton beach products again .
0	i had to buy one out on the road .
0	i hope it will be a better choice .
0	the kids thought it was great ,  but it got old pretty quick .
0	also the headphones do not feel comfortable on your head .
0	i mean she felt apart she broked down in a hundred pieces .
0	it almost fit ,  but not enough to snap completely together and fit .
0	i only ordered on here because they were alot cheaper .
0	try it once and you won t think it s stupid .
0	i was also very disappointed at how quickly it drains the batteries .
0	this case is cute however the is the only good thing about it .
0	this is a good hoodie and well made .
0	another num_num calories from the other num_num grams of carbohydrates .
0	i used the product for five days straight before running out .
0	went to the second one using the same method ,  no go .
0	if you are stir frying your ingredients  i . e .
0	so not that great for leaving on at night .
0	please reply with the filter part number and your location .
0	they have a medium pile lining that has more of a stiffer polyester feel .
0	it makes a buzzing sound when devices are plugged in .
0	we plugged in an extra headset laying around the house .
0	the description on the website did not state that the straps were elastic .
0	once you play one match ,  you ve played them all .
0	the computer recognized the usb connection ,  but the cursor never moved .
0	i don t think the saying  you get what you pay  .
0	that s not what it felt like with the original gel adhesive .
0	so far i am not at all happy .
0	i reported it havent heard a word about it .
0	it looks like i ve splashed glitter all over my face .
0	this case looks nice but that s about it .
0	as i get hit ,  my health endurance goes down .
0	i d suggest anyone looking to purchase linksys products look into netgear instead .
0	maybe it just needs broken in and some fine fitting .
0	i ve used it twice and it has stopped working .
0	i put it together to surprise my husband .
0	this did not stop odor and my pets wanted to eat it .
0	it s too bad because they look like they would keep my ears warm .
0	save yourself some time and money and skip this product .
0	i kept it though i do not use it .
0	i could barely get through it they taste so nasty .
0	amazon does not provide enough information about this press .
0	i can t send it back again because i don t have it .
0	i ve used these a few times and broke them very easily .
0	with this i say i work giving support to the u . s .
0	i had much better luck with the other three pairs mentioned .
0	there was nothing at all to indicate that belkin manufactured this item .
0	i say this as a guy with fairly thin wrists too .
0	i first used it on my hands and fingers .
0	like how many times you face the nazgul and how easily they are beaten .
0	me too is a nice brand and make very comfortable shoes .
0	is that what you re looking for ?  go elsewhere .
0	basically ,  this product is a ripoff on consumers .
0	this particular variety is rather lacking in the flavor department .
0	the jawbone may perform admirably as far as technology .
0	thank heaven the operation is intuitive because there are no instructions .
0	im thinking num_num gem stones in at least a num_num inch wheel .
0	my cat just isn t at all interested in these springs .
0	good for one day only . and opi test this product on animals .
0	it s the lame players that drives halo multiplay into the ground .
0	mine is a piece of junk ,  as far as i am concerned .
0	i have no idea if it s me or this product doing .
0	this is due to the short lived cheaper lasers they put in them .
0	i wore this product today for a few hours today .
1	washing it is a breeze and just takes a second .
1	this is definitely not the case with the num_extend
1	item arrived in num_num days in bulk packaging exactly like j .
1	i bought three of these units to place in our home .
1	i liked this and was happy with my purchase .
1	went looking for them and you had them .
1	with medium usage its closer to about num_num hours .
1	i don t want the bulk of an otterbox defender .
1	i made beef bolognese in the oven and it turned out wonderfully .
1	once glitch ,  which i did not view as all that negative .
1	synching is simple ,  with no passwords or codes required .
1	i wore my first one out by pouring hot gravies in it .
1	i would buy again if the shipping wasnt so long .
1	coming from an asian background it s not something we normally cook with .
1	simple !  does the job it was intended for .
1	exactly what i need for my phone and at the best price possible .
1	this is the old faithful water filter pitcher .
1	then both of them go into the dishwasher .
1	and it s a bread knife and nothing all that special .
1	open carefully and handle the zippers with care .
1	it can t be tightened at that point to fix it .
1	some reviewers complained of grounds in the coffee .
1	so i purchased another knife sharpener for this our num_num yankee swap .
1	get it ,  it s worth the price for sure .
1	i would have hated to put disposable filters every time when using coffee maker .
1	i received them as a christmas present and i love them .
1	take the whole thing out in the sink .
1	the unit itself rests like a necklace around your neck .
1	then into my phone and it chargers my phone .
1	i dropped phone once and the case held up perfectly .
1	also ,  don t use that yellow cloth to clean your phone .
1	this one does the job i need it for !  .
1	put homemade pizza sauce on top then add pepperoni and fresh mushrooms .
1	i have many oxo products ,  and i ve always been pleased .
1	also ,  the knife is easy to maneuver despite its length .
1	it had a great cost and a great product .
1	i finally made he purchase and am glad i did .
1	i bought this protective cover case for num_num cents plus shipping .
1	place it in the freezer and close the door .
1	i would definitely recommend this for a cute case .
1	i purchased it from one of the first  infomercials  .
1	i also like the adjustable heat option for the warming plate .
1	belt works fine and installed in just a few minutes .
1	he s heavy and stable enough to not tip over when it s windy .
1	i would have given a five star if the packaging with some bubble wrap .
1	in particular ,  the coating on this cookware has been cheapened .
1	that s what it does and it does it well .
1	i bought this to grind xylitol and truvia sweeteners into a powder for cooking .
1	either you will like it ,  or you won t .
1	however signal between transmitter and receiver does not work between insulated patio glass door .
1	i ve tried the pulls with prongs that go along side the cork .
1	obviously the margin of safety  from overflow  is much smaller .
1	easy to apply and it works very well .
1	i purchased this filter for a braun num_extend coffeemaker .
1	perfect fit for replacement in my num_num year old blender that still works .
1	doesn t get stuck on the rod like some non rollers do .
1	once it dies i will purchase a better unit .
1	my wife despises window fans usually and she loves this thing too .
1	i use it a lot ,  and it never gave me any problem .
1	my dish feels very solid to the touch .
1	so far has lasted for a long time and does not wear off .
1	i followed the guidance and am grateful for it .
1	i can hear the caller clearly ,  vice versa .
1	i would not suggest this on black iphones .
1	blocking the red hot coils from my cookie sheets ,  and glassware .
1	other than that small problem ,  this is a great bt headdest .
1	i imagine it will make soups even better than the old one as well .
1	so ,  to me this is pretty darn  instant  .
1	i have had this mount for about a year and it works great .
1	need a cheap car charger and it seems to do the job .
1	then i thought something was wrong with my car .
1	i can t remember when i first bought this timer .
1	i of course treated it with a wood sealant to last through the winter .
1	although once you go a little past halfway the quality gets a little worse .
1	i ordered it and it was delivered well in time .
1	i mainly use my blentec now but haven t sold the vitamix yet .
1	very impressed than within a minute incorporated all ingredients to perfection .
1	i just received a replacement bb curve from verizon .
1	nice not to have a burner going for hours .
1	of course the german s call this sort of idea good engineering .
1	durable and seems similar quality to apple products .
1	it does not slip all over the place when using .
1	and it ll keep rice perfect and hot for up to num_num hours .
1	the last time i did it was a year ago  .
1	i have to say that it was money well spent .
1	most pizza wheels that i ve seen are much smaller .
1	the price was good ,  and came quickly though my prime membership .
1	it holds the charge like when my phone was brand new .
1	these small cookie scoops made perfectly uniform two inch cookies .
1	easy to put on and i have no problems .
1	just do your homework and you will end up pretty satisfied .
1	i can t believe how strong this little guy is .
1	i like the oster steamer ,  it does everything it claim to do .
1	the cheese came out light and fluffy wished i had had one earlier .
1	the finer the setting ,  the longer it takes .
1	i think this case is a very nice phone case .
1	i use this with afresh to clean my cook top .
1	these wine stoppers are very inexpensive and certainly do the job .
1	maintenance cleaning is fast ,  neglected cleaning takes more time and repeated cleanings .
1	i have smaller bt headsets that last num_num hours longer .
1	we are ice cream lovers and fussy about the quality of ice cream .
1	so shipping takes a while but it is definitely worth the price .
1	i have several of these ,  well worth it .
1	i bought this in num_num and the pan is still in great shape .
1	short blades and longer handles give you the leverage you need for tough cutting .
1	it stays on and i unplug it when it s done .
1	just wipe the plates with a paper towel .
1	dash mounts are either bulky and in the way or not strong enough .
1	comes with a  towel  to clean the phone before placement .
1	i recently purchased  white rice  popcorn for my dad who has diverticulitious .
1	its actually a little better than the filter that came with the unit .
1	it s a very good quality at a reasonalbe price .
1	i never thought about making cheese until ree drummond made some on her show .
1	i have two of them in different locations in my house .
1	the flap also is good and does not come loose at all .
1	this product does what it is suppose to do .
1	even after several days ,  they are air tight in a wine bottle .
1	i haven t had any problems with teflon flaking off .
1	it moves plenty of air ,  oscillating between two rooms .
1	unless you have very small or very large hands it is comfortable to use .
1	it was the finger next to his hole finger .
1	this gets the job done for the price .
1	i followed the instructions and threw away the first num_num batches of coffee .
1	doesn t really reduce the fat anymore than most cooking methods .
1	only negative was delifery was num_num days late .
1	i estimate that four trips were made to empty and refill the water compartments .
1	it seems to be of very good quality in its build .
1	fill the pan half way with water ,  and put it to boil .
1	i shall be ordering a second one in the not too distant future .
1	i am glad that i did not spend a fortune on the electric models .
1	the instructions came over the motorola num_extend and were very clear .
1	i purchased the screen protectors for my evo .
1	i m convinced vacuum sealing works just as advertised .
1	the braun has it all . this is my second programmable flavorselect .
1	plugs the ipad into my car and works great .
1	it is the handiest thing for slicing potatoes for scalloped potatoes and chips .
1	however ,  this is an example of how rosle got it right .
1	i don t know how i ever managed without this handy devise .
1	pretty much all i ask for in a grinder .
1	you place all the ingredients into the bread maker .
1	the charger is working with my wireless bluetooth speaker just fine so far .
1	the head set is quite comfortable  at least for me  .
1	one minute per slice seems like a good rule of thumb so far .
1	you do have to hold a bowl when catching the meat you re grinding .
1	but for now ,  i m quite happy with this .
1	wrapped around me easily to tuck in for getting ready at the gym .
1	the grill surface is easier to clean than our other grills .
1	sometimes i m there for up to num_num hours .
1	if you need a pot with this capacity num_extend qts  buy this one .
1	look up videos on swype if you want to see it in action .
1	it was just one and that s not a big deal .
1	it works great and i am very happy with it .
1	no problems with this and worked with many devices .
1	both english and metric measurements are embossed onto each spoon .
1	we juiced our garden lettuce and greens with ease .
1	snug fit ,  with all the buttons and holes perfectly aligned .
1	i got this as a gift for my son .
1	may be it will become soft with use and then it should be fine .
1	really confused ppl riding with me at first .
1	i have both a square and round pan i use this with .
1	finish is great ,  and it makes great french toast .
1	that is sufficiently minor as to not affect my rating .
1	it keeps the air clean and nice fresh smelling .
1	puts together very easily and does what it s said it would .
1	hand graters can be a mess to clean ,  especially under the handle .
1	apparently there are thirteen more words required to successfully submit this review .
1	white in the refrigerator a couple of days longer .
1	love it !  really handy to set by the stove .
1	mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary .
1	we usually run it on low and it is relatively quite .
1	when purchased i discovered there was a newer product update :  model num_extend
1	i sprinkle a little flour on the rolls before stamping to prevent sticking .
1	order it with something else ,  and you ll get free shipping .
1	it would have been perfect if it was a tad bit smaller .
1	it should reconnect easily when you are in the num_extend
1	nothing bad to say about this wonderful innovation at all .
1	i would recommend this case to my friends .
1	love this mixer ,  wasn t near as loud as some were saying .
1	the cord is extra heavy to resist tangling .
1	for the size ,  weight and price it is really worth it .
1	i have been missing out !  this thing is so sharp .
1	also cheaper than going to the grocery store .
1	its like that showtime rotisserrie oven ,  you set it and forget it .
1	this cover does exactly what it is designed to do .
1	i feel like i have a new phone .
1	i was concerned for the price that these measuring cups would be flimsy .
1	i m starting to hate it because i don t need to upgrade .
1	recomiendo este vendedor porque tengo total seguridad que es una bella y honesta persona .
1	it is hard to go to anything else now that i have used this .
1	fits perfectly ,  cutouts are plsced where they should be .
1	i have had to replace the paddles as they wore out .
1	i though it would be faster and easier but it wasn t .
1	but it s not bad for wireless ,  i ve had worse .
1	as stated by the many reviews ,  this is an exceptinal carpet cleaner .
1	the la prima ran about half a shot then choked the machine .
1	all came well sharpened and ready to go .
1	auto shut off after num_num hours ,  which is a good feature .
1	and do not remove part one of the screen until part two is applied .
1	i put my kitchen appliances through the ringer .
1	anker is a fine product though i d never heard of it .
1	and yet it is compact and not too heavy .
1	a gas cooktop would be worse and a smooth cooktop probably much better .
1	anyway i recommend this one for its price and quality .
1	i purchased this to replace a knife that was lost .
1	this is the second one of these i have purchased .
1	these tongs seem to have the locking mechanism backwards .
1	and i have tried a lot of them .
1	on the other hand for power grating you ve got something here .
1	i had two problems ,  one caused the rating to num_num num_extend
1	not that anything sticks that much you just don t have to worry .
1	he read every amazon . com review as well as the zojirushi website .
1	i used this set with a toaster oven and with a coleman camping oven .
1	i ve only charged it once since i bought it .
1	saves on cleaning and the use of aluminum foil .
1	shipped free directly from realook and arrived within two days .
1	i have had two of these cans outside for over a year .
1	there is no warming plate in the unit but it doesn t need one .
1	i believe it was about $ when it came to market .
1	this little butter bell is a fantastic buy .
1	it basically picks up what is directly in front of it .
1	it it pretty hardy ,  i haven t broken it yet .
1	all in all ,  though ,  happy with the product .
1	this item works just as i thought it would .
1	i may even give some as gifts this holiday season .
1	glad i went for this one over some of the less expensive ones .
1	we have used ours at least a couple of hundred times .
1	i ve had to repair it a few times as it s % plastic .
1	i have been using this grill for num_num years .
1	i don t think pie weights are for me .
1	it doesn t require genius to get this unit operating .
1	it s still going great ,  i just needed more capacity .
1	it was just what i expected it to be .
1	fast; better than a blender and is easy to use .
1	i use this thing to core out the inside of a potato .
1	i have had mine for almost two years and they have not frayed .
1	it comes at a good price and appears to be well made .
1	great dutch oven ,  works well and fun to use on camping trips .
1	i had a less powerful one for num_num years before it finally gave out .
1	wish it had a crank or something to make it easier .
1	the shipping charges are now lower and upfront on the order .
1	yes ,  it is plastic ,  but not cheap plastic .
1	this turner has worked well for the last few years .
1	it has a num_num year warranty on defects too .
1	then along came this zester which i use constantly .
1	i think that is the way to keep the fish moist .
1	i have not been able to stop using it .
1	it s not as bulky feel as the other cases available .
1	that said ,  the mic did pic up everything it could .
1	however ,  slicing up tons of veggies can be quite time consuming .
1	the remaining sticker is attached to the second film .
1	we use these alot and they work great .
1	because it s made of cast iron ,  scorching is minimized .
1	i say that after trying many cheap pathetic headsets ,  sigh .
1	i do seem to need to invest in some better popcorn .
1	for example ,  the box says there s an led battery indicator light .
1	i love my lodge omelet pan and use it almost every morning .
1	this is the best cookware i ve ever owned .
1	i bought the lowest priced model more to test the brand than anything else .
1	these come in handy with those tender special moments and celebrations .
1	i can t believe i haven t owned one of these before .
1	i was torn between ordering the wagner steam cleaner and this mcculloch steam cleaner .
1	easily moved to various locations depending on need .
1	i would have given this five stars except for the only complaint i had .
1	replaced my pampered chef garlic press with this one .
1	this headset is awesome ,  the sound quality is truly amazing .
1	the tiny green light on one side is very bright when fully charged .
1	i had it a long time now and i still love it .
1	no more oil on my hands when cooking up a steak or falafel .
1	wow im impressed with this device !  how useful it is .
1	the glass cuisinart lids would pour water everywhere in a wet mess .
1	i did not have what i felt were unrealistic expectations of this device .
1	i think this size wont do a bigger bird than num_num pounds .
1	it s very simple and takes up very little space on the pot rack .
1	it works as advertised so i m happy !   :   .
1	i m not sure why this grinder got so many mixed reviews .
1	i have owned it for two years and it is a work horse .
1	it is easy to clean ,  but honestly i rarely clean it .
1	toasts bread ,  muffins and bagels with lots of options to choose .
1	cleans up nice and cooks waffles in a reasonable amount of time .
1	this one is available at a decent price with fair shipping here on amazon .
1	carrots will leave a big orange smear on the surface .
1	i can see i will be using it a lot .
1	i have never had a pleasant experience with the customer support at cuisnart .
1	but i like the phone to be up higher on the windshield . recommended .
1	i just bought a num_extend cubic ft chest freezer .
1	i wouldn t trade them but this is a great knife for the price .
1	great case ,  easy to use and very durable .
1	it works with all types ,  but works best with roma tomatoes .
1	i purchased two to mount horizontally under the shelves of my kitchen island .
1	only issue is the blue light it becomes a annoying after a while .
1	very good price but this one harder to use than my cusinart .
1	i use is for more than deep frying .
1	well worth the money ,  wouldn t want to be without it .
1	i bought this is a gift for my brother .
1	should have a wider design for different foods .
1	i can t believe how beautiful and substantial this ice cream maker is .
1	you ve probably seen them use it on iron chef .
1	i use this as a little office supply shelf .
1	it s more powerful so i expect it to be a little louder .
1	i also love it because the jar is plastic .
1	very nice unit ,  easy to assemble and operate .
1	tablets charge slowly ,  but that s to be expected .
1	they were awesome and they work great i like them a lot thank you .
1	i paid $ for this when i bought a few other pieces .
1	the cookbook that comes with it is adequate .
1	the bottom most container is not as small as one would think .
1	very sturdy with a good selection of teeth sizes .
1	otterboxes are a little bulky ,  but nothing protects better for the price .
1	i ve had this thermometer for about num_num years .
1	and it s much much cheaper than getting it at the cusinart parts site .
1	fair price . x x x x x x x x xx x .
1	i like it better than any of the forman items .
1	i will never have a phone without an otterbox again .
1	the only thing is it stretches easily so be careful with that .
1	with grandchildren ,  this is the perfect combination of colorful and functional .
1	much better than block and tackle type hooks to store overhead .
1	for the price ,  this is a good buy .
1	bento spoon and the boker knife which is quite nice .
1	: pi also have limited space in my kitchen .
1	i purchased the frieling to replace a glass bodum press that broke .
1	one corner is slightly taller than the other but its hardly noticeable .
1	i used to use a good cooks brand safety opener and really liked it .
1	i guess you could say so what it s a ladle .
1	would be five stars if it was out of slightly heavier material .
1	for my purpose this is the perfect item .
1	it turned out just fine to replace what i had lost .
1	i just flipped the pan over ,  and there they were .
1	this offers really good protection for the phone .
1	you have to break it in ,  in other words .
1	we use a bread machine to prepare the dough and provide the first rise .
1	i m a male ,  a bachelor who lives alone .
1	things i notice so far : + bluetooth num_extend streaming is solid .
1	heavy ,  patterned glass ,  and very classy looking on the table .
1	careful when using steak knives however because they will scratch these plates .
1	have been using it daily since it arrived .
1	we both use the blackberry num_num curve ,  which each use bluetooth version num_extend
1	then i used the attachemnts on my furniture and the water was gray .
1	it stay clean and does not collect food stains .
1	i would recommend to anyone who wants a pda .
1	i only wish the vacuum head was a little larger .
1	perfect size for preparing dishes . it really works well .
1	this knife sharpener more than met our expectations .
1	this pan is a bit heavier and truly nonstick .
1	the sound range and loudness is pretty impressive for the price and size .
1	it grinds it to a powder in just a couple of seconds .
1	the complication is the heft of the phone .
1	i installed this on a horizantaly sliding window .
1	it is close to the old one i had for years .
1	it keeps it the coffee hot and fresh for hours .
1	they come with full instructions and not much more to say .
1	once the lid closes ,  the smell goes away .
1	we often cook sausages ,  hot dogs and hamburgers in it as well .
1	i still have privacy screen ,  after num_num months .
1	i think the sensor is reading carpet fibers its sucking up as dirt .
1	the knife got a tad rusty after running it through a cycle .
1	if you want loud get the cdn num_extend count down big digit timer .
1	much to my dismay ,  the invisishield was nothing but garbage .
1	another thing i really like is that it does not have rivets .
1	it s very easy to use and very dependable .
1	now i just need to buy a catch can for the bottle tops .
1	the voice from the earpiece says  connected  on successful completion .
1	i never have problems answering the phone this way with my blackberry .
1	i am so glad we chose this one .
1	i m a fan of symbian and find it easy to operate .
1	tastes in between the classic american blonde ale and cowboy golden lager .
1	there are num_num blue lights to indicate the level of the unit s charge .
1	a must have if you have one of the older foodsavers .
1	i recommand smaller size for everyday use . but i like this pan .
1	i used a blade grinder for years before buying a burr grinder  .
1	it charges my phone very quickly and to full % battery .
1	the copper finish is coated with a clear plastic to prevent oxidation .
1	make sure the pins line up with the contacts .
1	i made flour tortillas that night for our mexican burrito dinner .
1	more creative than num_extend dont think so !  but still a great product .
1	it fulfills my modest requirements ,  and exceeds my expectations in appearance .
1	but these knives are well worth their price .
1	i have been extremely happy with my purchase .
1	the handle is comfortable and holds the pitchers securely in your hands .
1	i use it charge my batteries since my usb port is not an option .
1	what a change in my life this will make .
1	i love cooking and you need sharp knives when cooking .
1	hope this lasts longer than my last grinder so can buy as a gift .
1	this unit makes the best french fries i ve ever made .
1	recently threw in the trash as the line wore out .
1	no complaints and my wife loves the color .
1	this will compete with any top of the line knife you can buy .
1	i like almost everything except cucumber juice  echhh  .
1	great for about anything you want to shred ,  cut or mix .
1	i love the floral design and the colors .
1	this casserole dish is the perfect size and i love having a nice lid .
1	blade release buttons are simple to use which makes cleaning easy .
1	i ve owned this crock pot for several years .
1	it s almost like putting the phone into a high end pair of socks .
1	i can carry it in my pocket and use it when i need to .
1	i purchased these batteries based on the reviews of others .
1	like i said ,  it works ,  these are ok .
1	product arrived on time and was wrapped well .
1	this pan i have had for one year .
1	the case zipper shuts with a flap that covers the zipped part .
1	overall i love them ,  and would probably buy them again .
1	they get into the corners as described and are flexible yet firm .
1	i cannot wait to show it off ! thank you !  .
1	but the back side looks nice as well .
1	i also love that this griddle doubles as an indoor grill .
1	i use these reviews so heavily that i want to give back .
1	adds some bulk to phone but not a large amount .
1	fasy to keep clean and a real treasure .
1	researched before i bought it and had actually chosen another one .
1	there are num_num bright leds for taking pictures or just as a flashlight .
1	this happened after about num_num years of use .
1	delicious over fruit and kashii go lean crunch cereal .
1	will update this review should it meet a similar fate to my previous wheel .
1	i pretreated the worst stains withwoolite pet stain .
1	this keeps the cord out of the way and above the board .
1	a meeting my phone is in the bag charging .
1	this salad spinner is durable and easy to use .
1	the sound is also very surprising for the price and is enough for me .
1	the otterbox defender series is by far the best available .
1	no need to find storage place because it fits in any shallow drawer .
1	the daily challenge around here is keeping the cat fur to a minimum .
1	also these attachment pieces are very easy to clean .
1	i read all the reviews and decided on this one .
1	all my testing proves the same . hope that helps .
1	it s probably my phone but it happens constantly since i got the battery .
1	i bought it for a new iphone num_extend
