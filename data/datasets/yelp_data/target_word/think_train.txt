1	if you 're coming to eat ... ah you might think again !

1	i thought it was from a sloppy oil change .

0	needless to say , we will not be returning to this place .
1	at times we could barely hear ourselves think , let alone hear each other .
0	possibly the worst overpriced pizza there is .
1	think twice people before going here .
0	first of all , and the most important thing , they are not honest .
1	today however i think was not a great experience .
0	then when i got it , it was cold !
1	soggy , covered in sour cream and what i think was guacamole ?
0	tried to buy a book and have it shipped as a christmas present .

1	i do n't think sammy has ever even had a good corned beef sandwich .
0	on top of it , i got so sick .
1	i did n't think it was that good .
0	that is a lot for a less than adequate sandwhich .
1	not a big deal just thought it odd .
0	my kids would not even eat them .
1	i visited nc and thought this place was disgusting , i sure was right !
0	very annoyed and ignorant !
1	i thought it was a real stuffed horse at first glance .

1	the teenagers even thought it was mediocre .
0	most time i wait so long i end up going inside .
1	: ( i am thinking they do n't have good turnover .
0	this food is just crap .
1	i mean , we went here thinking we would get a good value .
0	it 's tough to find anything good here .
1	i think it was overpriced for a pittsburgh restaurant as well .
0	but also way over prices .
1	needless to say some people do n't think outside the box .

1	i think they probably deserve better .
0	real bad .
1	i think this breaks a record for me .

0	never going back .
1	the food : plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying .

1	i think steak 'n shake is just not my style .
0	mediocre service .
1	the place did seem busy , which i think is because of the groupon .
0	i only gave it _num_ stars because i liked my mac and cheese .
1	i patiently waiting thinking something was strange .
0	each time , i ask myself , `` why am i going back ? ''
1	do n't think i 'll be back to that pizza hut .
0	either the batteries are almost dead or its just terrible .
1	needless to say i do n't think i will be returning .
0	what the hell is going on people ?
1	for a destination dinner , i think not .
0	none of that .
1	the potato salad was the only thing that i actually thought was okay .

0	yet again , not one courtesy call , nothing resolved .
1	at first i thought maybe it was a fluke .
0	would not have my dogs teeth cleaned here !
1	no , i do n't think so .

1	i really think people buy these cakes because they do n't know any better .
0	terrible service , rude staff .
1	even thought that was our last drink there , it still pissed us off .
0	ingredients were n't fresh and the gyro was heavy on the spices .
1	so disappointing that 's how people think a business should be run .
0	the food was okay , but worst service ever .
1	this is not that kind of place , although it thinks it is .
0	she has an attitude and reluctantly made me a new one in _num_ minutes .
1	i do n't think i 'll give this place another chance .
0	i 'm sure you can find better accommodations in this price range and location .
1	but i do n't think i 'll be going back anytime soon .
0	second , the steak hoagie , it is atrocious .
1	the rental ended up being way more expensive than i had originally thought .
0	i did n't care .
1	thinking back and forth on it did n't seem right .
0	it then took quite awhile for our dinners to start arriving .
1	he was n't rude , i think just not up on server etiquette .
0	the food you need to be careful , because sometimes they are expired .
1	do n't think i 'll be coming back .
0	the restaurant across the street was apparently a night club as well .
1	i 'm thinking we 've struck out .
0	not a good value in my book .
1	dirty carpet , i do n't think it can be cleaned .
0	that 's sort of disappointing but still fine .
1	but today , i think i have had enough with this place .
0	so very bad that i 'm writing my first yelp review .
1	just thought we would give it another try .
0	for an appetizer , _num_ entrees , and naan .
1	i thought it was odd how many empty tables were in the bar area .
0	not really .
1	maybe it is just me , but i think it 's overrated .
0	after _num_ more min .
1	if you are thinking of renting here ... do n't do it !
0	the beer was good , service was ok , but the food was terrible .
1	i do not think i will go there again without a gift certificate .
0	a ton of cold shredded cheese thrown on top of pizza ?
1	you would think if they were slow all day the place would be spotless .
0	_num_ minutes later we had still not been acknowledged .
1	i thought the selection on the menu was pretty poor .
0	how disgusting .
1	she said , `` i do n't think this is a place for you .
0	we are never going back .
1	then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another .
0	i had a mani pedi today and they were brutal ... .
1	the first time , i thought maybe i just got a bad batch .
0	we paid for drinks and left our sever a gracious tip .
1	i think with some mustard this might have been great .
0	the sushi was not fresh .
1	so overall it was ok but certainly i would think twice before coming back .
0	unfortunately , the service is some of the worst i 've experienced in charlotte .
1	`` , which as a side note i thought was somewhat rude .
0	not going to recommend it to anyone .
1	i thought the flavor was okay but it was nothing special .
0	unfortunately , we threw out most of our entrees .
1	i 've driven past a million times and kept thinking to try noodles .
0	the food is bad !
1	to put it simply , he thought it sucked .
0	why did n't they do that in the first place .
1	just relocated to phoenix so we thought we would try out the zoo .
0	i took the olive oil off the table next to ours .
1	we thought is was cheap vinyl .
0	so fool me once , shame on me .
1	and i had no clue just thought it was the standard pick up area .
0	what i got was about _num_ inches taken off and no layers .
1	but , i think the tapas side is just terrible .
0	everything was pretty picked over , which kinda sucked .
1	do n't think i 'll be going back to this spot .
0	and it all is so bad .
1	while her sides were delicious she thought the chicken fingers missed the mark .
0	lettuce was ice cold , nearly frozen .
1	i dont think i 'd ever get a dance here .
0	no thanks .
1	i was beyond put off by this and thought it to be very unprofessional !
0	almost every order i 've placed had something forgotten or incorrect .
1	however i think they have the settings a little too high .
0	on top of that he is very rude and has no customer service skills .
1	she thought the potato side was just so-so .
0	they do n't know how to do business .
1	i think our server was just too busy with three other relatively big tables .
0	i wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area .
1	i am not that ugly ... i think .
0	the food is pretty forgettable .
1	i 'm still thirsty just thinking about it .
0	last i had the vegetarian curry dish , the only vegetarian main i found .
1	i do n't think i have one good thing to say about this place .
0	tram 's kitchen in my opinion is not really worth it .
1	i did n't think it could get any worse ... .
0	very unprofessional staff so far .
1	on second though i think my cafeteria was better .
0	what 's worse ?
1	i do n't think the price worth the food .
0	it was like getting waited on by 1st job people .
1	so dallas g and i were thinking of a lunch spot .
0	they were served with a side of bland , instant rice and black beans .
1	you really should n't even think of going here during lunch .
0	they are completely mean and disrespectful .
1	i really think our waitress forgot to put our order in .
0	avoid this place like the plague !
1	also , think about buying the warranty on used cars .
0	the egg roll was soggy and cold .
1	do n't think i 'll go back to dine in - ever .
0	i expected a nice tangy flavor to compliment the meat but was disappointed .
1	do n't think i would go to this venue again however .
0	could have being very good but it was not .
1	a chain restaurant i thought ; how bad could it be ... ?
0	for real , wasting money for wrong order !
1	however , i thought i would give it a chance .
0	or maybe i 'm wrong .
1	first off , i thought the service was mediocre to poor .
0	the sad part about this is they really try .
1	the decor made me think it would be much more affordable than it was .
0	the worst $ _num_ i 've ever spent .
1	he thought they would `` stay too long '' .
0	a little pricy for food but not too bad .
1	the only thing i could think is they were hoping shift changes ?
0	swing and miss .
1	food is unfortunately mediocre not what we thought .
0	but it seemed like i was absolutely bothering the staff this morning .
1	i do n't think an intelligent word came out of her mouth .
0	more frustrating than conversations with the wall .
1	whatever you were thinking of getting done ... do n't do it there .
0	we 've had too many problems to list all of them .
1	i think this should be more like _num_ stars .
0	she brought our soups , which luckily had spoons in the huge bowls .
1	one would think that the owners would at least look at the reviews .
0	at our table and then left prior to ordering .
1	you 're probably thinking $ _num_ or $ _num_ , right ?
0	we feel like our money was wasted .
1	i am not sure how someone thinks this food is great .
0	also the pizza was bad .
1	that being said , i think that they would be better off elsewhere .
0	i 've taken my car here at least twice .
1	overall , the worst restaurant in phoenix , i think .
0	no personality and did n't make us feel welcome .
1	dive bar hell yes , a good one i think not .
0	but we never let the house get to a point of disaster .
1	i do n't understand why this place think 's it has famous corned beef .
0	the service in this store is ridiculous .
1	i think one star is being highly generous for this restaurant .
0	i fed my whole family breakfast ( _num_ of us ) for $ _num_ .
1	i was thinking he would have stopped but did n't oh well .
0	do not use , awful experience !
1	i do n't think their menu is limited though , it seemed fairly typical .
