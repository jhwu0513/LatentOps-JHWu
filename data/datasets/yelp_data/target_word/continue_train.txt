1	so he continued to stand by me as i looked at the selection .
0	it looked like someone 's basement or garage with tables in it .
1	i will continue to take my vehicles to richard 's auto clinic .

1	i 'm continued to be so disappointed by the `` hostess '' .
0	it was a wet tasteless mess .
1	just literally continued to scream .
0	the two bites of my pork belly sandwich were pretty alright though .
1	will continue going there and will recommend .
0	my gripe here is that i ended up with scratches on my wheels .
1	we come here and often and will continue to do so .

1	needless to say , my money went elsewhere and will continue to do so .
0	her reply `` no .
1	it 's my own fault for continuing to frequent this grocery store .
0	why would anyone even pay for such lousy food ?

0	i 'd give this store negative stars if there was an option .
1	do n't continue to try and sell me something else .
0	this is not the courtyard i was expecting .
1	the old guy continued to drink wine and yelled at another waitress .
0	the first was flavorless and cold .
1	i had the runner take it back and continued to wait for my plate .
0	they probably knew we would n't have the money for a lawyer .
1	i will continue to go here weekly .
0	in fact , it was awful .
1	i will continue using them .
0	waited about another _num_ minutes after we finished our food to receive our check .
1	time after time this store continues to disappoint .

1	this dealership continues to display it 's lack of customer service .
0	the bride chose a dress hoping it would look better in a smaller size .
1	the food continues to be pretty inconsistent and is most noticed in your soups .

1	so at this point we were a little taken back but continued in .
0	it 's like they hate their lives .
1	continuing on ... so i had been wearing acrylic for about half a year .
0	its not very good at all .
1	even into high school in the 90s i continued to shop here happily .
0	they also have fake sales .
1	the room continued to be unimpressive .
0	so i might not be the target audience .
1	continue to be horrible .
0	our server was obviously having a bad night .
1	we waited another _num_ minutes and continued to watch other groups being seated .
0	i get it .
1	the sense of urgency continues to get worse .

1	she continued to look over us and continued on with other business .
0	$ _num_ a glass of garbage wine ?
1	i visit , and will continue to do so at every opportunity .
0	waste of time and money overall .
1	no continuing maintenance is going on .
0	it seems ridiculous , actually .
1	not to mention i think the quality of sushi continues to get worse .
0	we made the unfortunate decision to make a reservation here for a special occasion .
1	i 've used her several times , and will continue too .
0	nobody else even ordered drinks while we were there .
1	you continue to treat your customer like crap they will leave .
0	this was my second time staying at this hotel with the same problem .

1	the visit continued to be awful .
0	to put it lightly ; the staff suck !
1	then a girl continued my bowl .
0	nothing special .
1	sadly , that is not enough reason for me to continue going here .

0	i 'm always always always made to feel like i 'm stupid ( seriously ?
1	... continues to be the slowest drive through in maricopa county .
0	but also way over prices .
1	then continued to walk away .
0	to be fair , our assigned server was very nice .
1	i really feel sorry for those who continue to buy from here .
0	dear pittsburgh , we are foodies from boston .
1	the slow service continued all night .
0	worst hotel i have yet to stay in as a consultant .
1	the only reason we continue to go is that they are close and cheap .
0	this is not a place that a neighborhood should support .

0	this place is awful .
1	this starts at the first hole , and continues through most of the course .
0	should i really tell him how much he deserved ?
1	i will continue to dine here .
0	highly questionable hygiene for a food store !
1	budget should replace him immediately , or they will continue to loose more customers .
0	so , i will never be back .
1	then he would stand there continuing on his phone .
0	parking at the hotel is expensive .
1	many restaurants to choose from , i will continue to avoid this place .
0	just in the way it is laid out and with the choices .
1	well ... the customer left and they continued to stay up front talking .

0	that 's total bullshit .
1	after several visits for breakfast they continue to be slow .
0	i would give this restaurant _num_ stars if i could .
1	we come here often and will continue .
0	ridiculous policies and move out fees .
1	the only reasons i continue to come here is _num_ location and _num_ price .
0	it 's clear auto only cares about quantity not quality .
1	i got one $ _num_ credit but it did n't continue .
