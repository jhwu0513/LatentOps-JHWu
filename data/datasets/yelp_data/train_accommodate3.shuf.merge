we did n't end up paying and went and ate somewhere else .
we saw them turn away at least _num_ other families for the private party .
it pains me to leave any tip for them .
when i asked him when he did this , he walked away .
very helpful staff !
the broth was so good and the fish was so tender .
he is fast , thorough and has the newest technology .
cant wait to see it .
ridiculous .
i 've been to this place twice and would never come back .
i had some slam , not sure which one but everything was bland .
awful , even the manager does not have customer service skills .
fun and elegant happy hour !

the manager was yelling at the cashier while we placed our order .
the man painting her nails was also very rude to her .
peaches , canned .
they basically the best beignets i have ever had .
we ordered the catfish , baked potato , macaroni and muffins .
`` free limo and no cover '' my ass .
it 's good stuff .
we had n't been there in some time and we wo n't be back .
the dumplings were also a favorite of mine too !
but very good pad thai and salad .
great place , one i 'll be visiting quite often .

this is my favorite place in town for gyros .
some things cold , when they should be hot .
the park lunch was n't as relaxing after this incident .
it seems like they checked out .

this hotel is not one of them .
highly recommend the white widow and the jamaican ' both sandwiches are amazing !
a must stop for the best food and service in vegas .
shame shame shame , did i say shame ?
love being able to see so many options in one place .
oh , and there is no air conditioning .
i gave them plenty of chances to just fix it ... .

but aside from that good job guys !

i was beyond shocked !
give it a try and thank me later .
for what it is , best i 'd say in this area !
i would absolutely eat here again .
so the salesman sent me to another store down the street from them .
it is a big space that always has plenty of room .

that 's why i ask you to please tell me what i 'm missing .
find another resort !
cool joint to hang out outside and relax .
i really want to thank brandon .

i can definitely say this place is one of the best for service .
the other three entrees were ok with the worse part being the rice .
love the price too !
i keep telling myself to branch out but they 're such perfect lunches .
host never greeted me and was around the corner talking with co-workers .
first of all , not sure why this is called a `` resort . ''
great customer service !
Negative
the problems started at check-in when my room was n't ready .
i love it here and i 'm so glad i found this place .
the store itself does n't offer as much as other michaels locations .
always polite workers & music .
poor service .
also , staff was very patient , helpful , and friendly .
just love how my nail needs are always taken care of .
there were no complaints with the chicken , the only star of this evening .
this hospital is just a money making scam .
even when it 's free .
the decor was nice and comfortable .
the sandwich itself had a little , thin piece of meat in it .
friendly , caring , and honest .
mess mess mess .
i wish i had read their reviews prior to going .
they are reasonably priced and i was happy with the service .
unfortunately it was n't .
love the honey toast .
what a great knowledgeable staff .
i always see lynn she does pure gel nails with a tip .

overall it was a great experience .
i love seeing pat and michelle every morning .

the sauce tasted very ketchup like and the chicken had no flavor .
even if there is only one other car in there at the time .

this course has a great layout , however it is in very poor condition .
save yourself the time and frustration of going to this office !
i ordered the biscuits and sausage gravy and really enjoyed that too !
highly recommended !
green chili anything is awesome !
the hotel itself is very clean and our room was clean too !
they do a beautiful job .
the only thing that might be worth it is the sake .

however was told julie does n't do appointments .
she did a great job .
does n't this place know that every other rental place is more efficient ?
this med spa truly offers the best of both worlds .
friendly service great people and an enjoyable environment .
it 's pretty hard to mess up a pizza as simple as a margherita .
this place is so delicious !
she helped us set it up !
the sandwich was a good size though and took half of it home .
a little gem .
not worth it at all .
i would like to give it a higher rating but just ca n't .
it might seem out there , but boy is it worth it .
so i had a va appt that was scheduled for me to go here .
very clean and comfortable .
they did a very good job on both .
some of the language was suspect , but other than that it was great !
first , it is small , smaller than it lets on .
i ordered street tacos and they were an absolute joke .
they are worthless !
i do n't even think the bacon is worth coming here for .
it was all amazing !
problem is , it 's hardly ever good .
the owners were great !
they even had me laughing !
they will do their best to help .
food was pretty good .
very impressive customer service .
this is a well organized , clean and friendly location .
i was not impressed and , moreover , a little disappointed .
i am seriously disappointed and frustrated with my experience at this place .
sorry but my dollars will be spent where my business is appreciated !

great food and outstanding wine and view .

i was told they would get me right in and look at it .
i 've only had good experiences with the office staff as well .
you can tell it 's quality ingredients .
i was so overwhelmed ( in a good way ) .
well , i completely agree with tina !
mmmmm ... steak .
the baristas are awesome and the coffee is great .
and she did a great job !
where is the santa fe omelette ?
we had n't even looked at a car yet .
i cant stress how good this shop is .
awesome experience !
when we arrived to the room , there was a significant chemical smell .
so gorgeous .
that ca n't be good for business .
again , this was my experience with quality inn and suites .
this place has superb food at great prices .
just purchased my third car from them and it was another great experience !
the us air passenger service agents are complete jerks .
i usually come before closing and the staff always looks annoyed and angry .

the food and service is always amazing .
love this gym !
on my lunch break , enjoyed the music while relaxing with some great food .
i could n't have been more wrong .

i went this afternoon and had a great time .
i will return another day !
my family and i loved the service and food !
if i could give negative stars , i would .
it all went down the past few weeks .
all in all nothing was really that tasty .
no wonder nobody was here on a saturday night .
just terrible .
very professional guys who seemed to have regulars they called by name .
it 's not great but i 've come to love it .
the staff is friendly and the store is clean .
steamed egg great , miso soup great and it 's all you can eat .
nice and warm garden especially in the winter .
also the driver forgot to bring my drinks .
the staff are wonderful .
definitely better than filibertos .
enjoyed the time there .
the food is amazing .
we split the chopped salad with gorgonzola .
there were _num_ other people in the store and they were looking around .
great spot to pick up something for a dinner party !
way good prices .
my worst fear of not ordering or having enough food has happened !
if you want it done right , go to habib 's !
as mentioned below , this is a great hidden spot .
i went here the other night and it was a fairly not awesome experience .
but tonight was not that case .
overall great place to eat .
clean , friendly , get what you paid for kind of deal .
soup was mediocre .
this dentist and his office manager have the worst customer service skills .
talking about building a personal connection with customer , this place is the best .
i did n't know the difference .
when i get to the checkout counter the staff is not personable at all .
$ _num_ in additional fees .
i like red robin but not this location .
did n't seem very interested in serving me at all .
i 'm never coming back .
she made sure to explain everything before she did it .
my favorite asian restaurant in madison .
we ended up having the best time !
the food is mediocre at best .
great pizza !
lots of interesting brownies and pastries !
every employee is extremely nice , polite , and very helpful !
it 's sorta crammed in the end of a parking lot .
for a small local eatery it is very fresh and very good .
they have specials only on sundays which are always so delicious .
fresh sushi every day too .
however the employees here are extremely sweet especially holly !
gets a major `` skip it '' rating from me .
dr. v made us feel confident in his expertise and explained the surgery well .
they 'll take your money but do n't try to get customer service !
so rude !

the jerk chicken is delicious .
he said they were very disorganized when he was there , bad service .
we went for the beer specials , which were good .
great pizza and great wings .

all in all a great spot .
she made me feel totally comfortable and was super kind .
the inside is okay !
love it !
got a great cut with daniel .
all 's i can say is tony 's back !
super casual upstairs lunch joint on state street .
clearly not , sir .
by the way , they keep their bathrooms in tip top shape .
they say you can not cancel , it is ready for pickup .
this place is totally madison rich people food .
every time i 've been here , i 've been unsatisfied .
love their food .
this place is great and has alternatives to brand cigars .

i would n't recommend this salon .
needless to say that was quite wonderfully sweet in a few ways !

highly recommended .
add a pumpkin spice coffee to top it off !
we used the laundromat and it is wicked nasty .
i like paying $ _num_ in fees for a $ _num_ beer .
good experience , food and its price and of course the cheesecake !
several companies are moving in the direction of `` green '' restrooms .
they go above and beyond to make things work .
worst walmart in town .
the staff is always friendly and the food is fresh .
the burger came with onion straws , bacon , cheese and burger patty .
the meat was almost mushy and only had a small splash of sauce .
awesome , friendly staff .
seems like you would be more supportive of paying customers .
great place for outdoor lunch , great service , great food !
one of the nicest malls i 've ever been to .
the food was alright except for my sisters food .
they have the best patio ever out back .
i can put up with a lot of things for a cheap dinner .
what a sweet way to end a day on the south side !
a cool pub serving authentic english dishes .
the owner made everything extremely awkward from basically the moment that we sat down .
and they deliver !
it was a wonderful meal !
best staff , best food , best happy hour !
i 've been going here since i was a little girl after church .

i 'm glad i checked it out .
atmosphere was also great .
awesome !
awesome food and great service .
good value , freshly prepared , friendly service , great menu variety !
any other einstein 's is better than this one .
our consultant did n't pull any dresses for us .
the service is amazing , the staff are very attentive .
its worth a trip just to read the signs and bumper stickers .
otherwise , it is annoying .
wish there was a choice of no stars .
the bad : raw oysters were frozen .
great donuts !
a terrible experience .
the accompanying mashed potatoes were also quite cold and lumpy .
i did not , however get the best .
lisa was our server at lunch and she is excellent .
great little family owned restaurant .
great place to watch games as they are covered wall to wall with televisions .
nice size bar and lots of beers on tap !
loved the artistic theme !
best sushi guys ever .
great store .
everything in the store smells amazing !
tsa security is the worst .
i will not be going here again .
why do they call it jiffy lube ?
i will definitely go back and try their other dishes .
we had no ice bucket , not enough towels and the window was open !
it 's more like a group cafeteria setting but comfortable .
i explained that i was pissed .
the burritos are good , servings are huge .
it 's really great to find these foods in phoenix .
loved it .
stopped by this bbq joint while in vegas , loved the food !
the food was more disgusting than the restaurant .

i stayed at the resort next to the hooters casino .
i loved it - totally different from everything else i have played .
my experience at this verizon location was quick , easy , and fun !
not to mention it was not big at all .
classic diner food , a lot of which is made from scratch .
love this place !
that would 've been a mistake .
my salmon was thin , overlooked , and fishy .
nice relaxing atmosphere !
your sister should not be your receptionist .
no doubt , a great hidden gem of phoenix .
lots of fun memories .
love the strong margaritas and good food too .
my secret favorite item is the bbq pork sandwich you have to micro wave .
will never rent from hertz at the location again !
the place is run down it def .
the food is amazing .
could n't even get silverware without asking even after food was on the table .
this is the best i 've had so far , by far !
california eggs benny is one of our favorites .
the only good thing i can say is the chips were good .
no lauren .
very reasonably prices in the heart of town !
i thought the food courts were nice and spacious .
such a great restaurant !
nice stay although hotwire hit me w extra fee for resort fee .
i agree that this place is underrated .
and of course the beer was good and very well priced .
unfortunately , i do n't agree with their choice .
mind you , i was totally alone .
they claimed i needed a new radiator and quoted approximately $ _num_ .
friendly service , small restaurant .
just got back from having breakfast with the girls !

the vets , however , can be really pushy .
habib is fantastic !
hands down , this is my favorite sushi spot .

it 's a great place to see a $ _num_ band at any rate .
they are very effective and helpful and i have always felt welcome .

too much salt !
i do n't know the food well enough to take huge chances .
probably never will .
i loved it here and i will be coming back !
the best part was they only changed a minimal fee for the service .
the greek salad is a great accompaniment with its homemade balsamic vinaigrette .

dustin is a very skilled specialized tech with great customer service skills .
i love pizza but was really disappointed with this place .
as usual , let 's start with the bad news .
the open salsa bar with _num_ distinct flavors : very wonderful .

fifteen years and i 'm still a happy customer !
i bring family and friends and will continue .
this place was so delicious and i ca n't wait to go back .
the food is delicious !
their roasted eggplant is very good .
they did an excellent job with the entire spread .
the fresh rolls were also quite delicious .
right now there is the manor twin , and this place .
great ( and endless cups of ... ) coffee .
best sandwiches in town .
the rice was too dry , and there was barely any flavor .
i found a property online that i fell in love with .
the machaca burritos are amazing too .
before you attempt to shop here , know your prices .
hope this helps .
no one would have ever known the difference .
you can go out once and have no desire to ever go out again .
the girls there are incredibly rude and incompetent .
i had a great time here last night .
lots of good memories in this restaurant .
the girls that were working today we 're all very nice and friendly .
good selection of beers , i don ; t care about wine !
they check everything so that is always a plus .
highly recommended .
loved this place .
great time for dinner .
highly recommended !
i love this very friendly and homey place .
ugh .
well the tacos at cabo are delicious !
the menu is large with a lot of choices .
unlv is heading in the right direction .
secondly , they do n't clean the tables too often .
the cashier would n't even look at me or respond to my question .
the food is seriously lacking .
so susan the ma set me up with an appointment that night at 6pm .
lee 's is a quality liquor store .
our office will not call or order from you again !
love love love this place !
what a waste of $ _num_ bucks for the food i got .
not fresh at all , tasted like it was day old .
the cashier is so sweet and the food is always great .

bad service .
good guy to small talk with too .

food was pretty good and atmosphere was nice .
unfortunately , we probably wo n't be back .
she simply took his weight down , & placed us in a room .
relaxed atmosphere .
our appetizer was served by a runner and another runner served our entrees .

i have been here several times now and i definitely like it .
my favorite spot for breakfast in madison !
my experience did not turn out well .
great fried chicken and blackened meatloaf , and the best fried oysters on earth .
the food is excellent .
i support small businesses but never again will i even walk in that place .
_num_ .
walk away .
we found this place by chance , thank goodness .
this is a sad excuse for a business .
we did , and i am happy that we did so .
i buy balloons and cards for special events here .
always use the bathroom and it 's always clean .
service is friendly and timely bringing out your food .
on my way home i noticed there was no sauted mushrooms i ordered .
the selections and prices are great .
we were seated and ordered our drinks and all was well .
the price is right the people and service are extraordinary .
i wish i could give less than one star .
we hope they keep their success and grow !
the facility is old and rundown and the staff is n't very helpful .
definitely a great choice for some good southern food that is n't too expensive .
sausage and pepperoni pizza was delicious !
it was very good .
everything we have tried is great .
went here awhile ago to get a cut with a barber i was recommended .
lobster bisque ... great homemade soups ... bagel sandwiches and wraps are very good.
it was kinda messy but so worth it !
and eva bartender pretty great too !
the risotto was undercooked and had no flavor .
these guys were great .
my husbands bone in rib eye was a tasteless overcooked disaster .
my husband ordered a _num_ vintage red from the wine list .
dana at acura service of tempe is without a doubt the best .
the meat is sweet , and reminds me of snow crab , just bigger !
well be back .
will not be going back !
even the vet technicians were sympathetic and made me feel comfortable .
the lunch sandwiches and soups are hearty and well-made .
if you want good authentic food this is the place !
nor would we still be unsatisfied after a 2nd counter tops was installed .
burger was big tasty and messy .
fantastic service !
the fish was definately frozen and overcooked , chewy and lacking flavor .
this whole foods is our favorite one in this area .
the bread is freshly made ; the marinara pasta sauce just perfect .
the staff is wonderful ... very friendly .
this hotel is fantastic !
excellent breakfast !
thank 's for the great service !
there are a lot of places to sit inside .
tuna sandwich is my favorite !
it was n't me .
during my visit , they were also offering a new cocktail on special .
the worst !
$ _num_ for a nail trim is ridiculous !
it is safe , family-friendly with nice green areas and pool .
you can tell they love their job !
this place really disappointed me .
the employees are friendly , helpful and curteous .
this is honestly the best nail salon in the valley !
they go above & beyond !
trick or treat .
thanks to all the staff for all you do for us .
best steakhouse i 've ever been to .
the reason why i rate this place low is the atmosphere is abysmal .
it was such a disappointment since i heard it was so good .
the food was delicious , all of us thought so .
overall though i was so let down and would not return .
awesome course .
i will not go here again .
the rooms were very nicely designed and provided a ton of space .
highly recommend !
as a customer i really do n't care .
the flavor was fabulous on everything that each of us tasted .
this outback needs a total overhaul !
cute place in phx to eat .
even better : it 's free with the meal !
also great as hangover food , and for lining your belly before a party .
you are better off with burger king .
i tried one of the lunch bowls : pepper steak .
good guys here !
i would n't get it again .
here 's a place that is a good all around theater .
the squash casserole and the sweet potatoes are also quite good .
food is great .
this is a fantastic nursery , with beautifully arizona grown plants and trees .
obviously , they do not follow orders nor listen to your requests .
great for the whole family .
the food is standard bar quality fare and the wings and burgers are meh .
the whole place seems like a free for all with no authority .
the team is professional , nice and courteous .
so yummy !
this is a cute starbucks , nice staff , pretty speedy service .
odd menu , poor choices , poorly presented .
perfectly cooked .
i think i 'm done giving them a chance and my money .
fried to die for .
overall shitty experience , bland food and overpriced menu .
if you never had korean bbq before this is a great place to start .
i would n't even take them if they were free !
1st it reeks of cigarettes .
i was frustrated and just left .
the coffee here is atrocious .
it would have been an expensive job , too .
- plus they have no clue how to run a restaurant .
only if i could give this place negative stars .
this was after waiting over an hour for hamburgers and hotdogs !
the service was great when i picked up the truck .
really need to put some money into this place .
great people .
the prime burger was absolutely amazing !
one of the best sub places in the area .
left before we could try food .
very impressed with the front desk ladies as well !
everything here is great !
terrific food , clean dining area , and friendly customer service .
our food was cold and they use frozen patties for burgers .
the last two times they 've provided a dreadful experience .
i 'll help you , this place is bad .
all the great things about trader joe 's are to be found here .
but well worth it for the wings .

i should have went to the big irish bar instead .
great service , amazing italian cuisine and definitely a strong , loyal following .

great beer choices .
the staff is extremely friendly and helpful as well .
very , very happy with that level of customer service .
this property just needs to be torn down .
great attention to detail and quick as well .
the front desk has no customer service skills after you check-in .
parking on the street is a bit tight , but its definitely worth it .
veal is free range veal that was bland , dry somewhat tough and tasteless .
extremely disappointed in this company .
food poisoning is awful .
i guess the worst part of the meal was the fries and hushpuppies .
my waiter was obviously overworked .
but if the customers cared about good coffee , they would not go here .
love it .
the airport is bright and clean and offers lots of shopping and dining options .

quite beautiful , challenging , fair and really well maintained .
excellent place for subs , cool joint to chill too .
we loved the atmosphere and the personalized customer service we received from the owner .
checked the beds right away when we checked in .
despite his initial rudeness , i invited him in .
they are always so helpful !
the operator told me to wait for a call from the technician .
it should have been more like a salad and less like a mayo spread .
gorgeous sunset people running around to their flights .
a little pricey , but worth it !
the office told me to come in right away .
_num_ . )
go and enjoy !
& i have sampled most of it !
but the last few visits sure were disappointing .
i looked around saw only _num_ tables with patrons with 4-5 restaurant staff .
regardless of the fact that we did n't eat it that 's still disgusting .
this may be the worst mcdonalds in charlotte .
hopefully another will come around .
in the end , my feet feel and look great .

this place is just a very basic , no frills cafe .
their customer service while i was at the store was impeccable .
they staff there is extra friendly and the store is clean .

she made this clear _num_ times .

they had some nice quality items , however , it was quite pricey .

i always went for very basic services ( routine cleanings ) .
they have the best pie i 've had for decades !

the price is worth it .
yet another friend loves their pumpkin pie .
the only thing the servers did was bring out water and our pho .
they also have burgers and shakes .
sesame chicken was great !
my pho was not really good .
great ambiance .
everyone was so nice !
wonderful family-owned cleaners who saved my clinic jackets for school !
i will definitely be back for all of my jeweler needs !
the light rail makes it incredibly easier to get to as well .
- the food tastes so-so .
they did a terrific job on my hair .
_num_ star service with very good and competitive prices .
one of the worst major airports .
try it .
so its probably a walking fest pool _num_ % of the year .
no one seems to care .
i was not overly impressed .
april his front office assistant makes everyone feel at ease .
i do n't need a rude , stuck up vet !
also the salad is n't great .
moon valley has done a great job and julie is the best !

the driver was very nice and courteous but that 's where the positives end .
the phone was in perfect shape and having major battery drain .

the employees seem slow , stupid , and lazy .
when i asked for more i was given such an attitude .
great breakfast joint .
very good man drinks , very good lady drinks .
great hours .
slow and horrible .
plus i really liked the lucky cat statues at the registers .
the bread and salads and soups are great .
yah , does n't work for me .
this walmart was unusually clean and stocked plenty of goods .
it 's incredibly clean and a comfortable park to relax or exercise in .
i know they have good fresh bread and other ingredients .
and it was cold - did n't even take my winter coat off .
worst photo department i have ever seen .
i highly recommend moon valley and bruce miller + team !
from the perfect hand cut fries to the over the top burgers .
i definitely thought it was important to note that .
i , unfortunately , did not have a positive experience with any of these .
he arrived and was also unable to open the door .
too bad .
online , their women 's haircut price is quoted at $ 30+ .
this place has it 's own personality !

they will have my business going forward !
holy crap , this place is horrible !
best assortment of chocolate i have ever seen !
still , totally fun place .

because when you want fast food , an extra _num_ minutes is nothing .
the staffs are super friendly !
i wish i could remember her name .
the hubby was not happy .
i 'm very torn about this place .
the small spring roll was a nice little touch and very good !
not even a week later the car stops working again !

bread is something i would come here again for !
the guy waiter was not much nicer .
you were warned .

`` you bit into the wings , so no refund . ''
do n't waste your vacation time ( or money ) with their games .

the prices might be a little higher , but the service is good .
_num_ % recommend .
it was smooth and creamy and the whipped cream was lightly whipped just perfectly .
great burgers and fries ... .
my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh .
that combination is so delicious .
everyone was polite but i just could n't sit and wait any longer .
i was in town on business and they had great rates for the location .
my nails were n't too thick and they look natural for sure .
fun atmosphere , mediocre service , good ( not great ) food .
my mom , stepped in between us to stop .
they were fantastic !
they ruined our shopping day .
their mashed & baked potatoes are good , so is the coleslaw .
they were n't even freshly made chips !
but getting water refills or even a couple of forks was an ordeal .
everything was very beautiful .
and normally i never get sick to my stomach .
the lady who runs the office is unpleasant and rude .
dated but reasonably clean .
i was treated with respect and care .
i had chicken of the angels , and it was very salty .
nice crew and very professional .
food is outstanding .
so amazingly fresh and an incredible taste .
great food , pleasant service , amazingly affordable food .
went to purchase a beer brewing kit that he tried to overcharge me on .
especially bus # _num_ !
it was bad ... the you ca n't drink it kind of bad .
this is the largest cockroach i have ever seen in my life .
the restaurant was dated and the food quality was not the best either .
does n't mean that zinc bistro ca n't be unique .
first time my wife and i came here the service was awful !
hell , i 'm the one paying for the visit !
just goes to show you can get what you like here !
terrible selection , rude !
my family had all different cuts of fish and they were all prepared expertly .
this is by far the best dry cleaner i 've found in the area .
so overall my experience fell short due to the staff more than anything else .
the yelpers helped me out again .
horrible motel !
the place is always clean and everyone is very pleasant .
i will not be going to this place again and neither should you .
fantastic !
by then , i was almost finished with my meal anyway .
owners are very nice and friendly .
on a scale of 1-10 ( spice ) .
so i left it and walked out .
!
my stylist also was not good at placing the highlights .
frankly , i thought it was terrible .
we should have taken it as a sign and walked out .
this is not a fancy , trendy place , but they do good work .
i highly recommend him as a dentist !
i rarely give bad reviews , but this was a pretty horrible food experience .
the staff is very friendly and helpful too .
they really live up to their motto a miracle in the desert .

i stopped in just because i was in a hurry .
their prix fixe menu gives almost unbelievable value on truly fine eats .
everyone loved what they ordered .
the shining stars here are the owners and clerks .

this place is slow beyond belief .
the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating for our family of _num_ .

just hop out the car and run inside and get your food and leave .
management is a complete joke .
best smoothie place near uptown charlotte that i 've been to .
ugh , wal-mart , the store i love to hate .
would never return if i did not have to .
not worth eating out .
the rest of the staff is pretty cool too .
if i went back , i would only get the salad .
but it was room temp and runny .
probably one of my favorite places to go and get a nice burger .

they had three chances to get it right , and struck out every time .

such a refreshing good hole-in-the-wall place off the strip .

the cheese fondue appetizer was good ; but the entrees were tasteless .

the best sandwich shop in las vegas !
the food was very disappointing .
this is by far my favorite buffet .

probably the best traditional sandwich shop in the city .
i got sick that night .

this place is very inexpensive and the staff is nice .
the people were interesting , and the owner extremely nice !
personal favorites are the works and the sausage pesto pizzas .

anyways , i definitely recommend coming here .
very good italian .

the service was really really good .
this place seriously hit the spot .

paper thin and always kept breaking .
i have no problem with that , never did , never said i did .
my experience with the woman who helped me sign all the paperwork was great .
i could purchase that for at least $ _num_ less at whole foods .
great sense of style , taste , and always honest .
thank you aj 's , you are the best !
not the service or the food .
the cucumbers were wonderful .
such poor patient care !
this inside gives you a east coast feel ... .
good local spot .
this use to be the go to place because the food was always consistent .
we spoke with the owner eric and he said that was not true .
well organized and clean .
overall , red lobster is becoming one of my favorite chains .
food was fresh and prompt .
really good korean food and very fresh sushi .
so happy to have finally found a good chinese restaurant that delivers .
every dish we had was completely flavorless .
worst customer service !
it was excellent , high quality and reasonably priced .
customer service is not what it used to be .
chicken parm is excellent and the sandwiches are a must try .
very fun place , great staff !
it was a hit for our mother 's day celebration !
i would definitely recommend them !

a big thumbs up .
the bun was stale and the eggplant was soggy .

all in all , a solid visit .
the staff i 'd also very nice .
the food was delicious !
amazing quality and service .
club had a great remodel .
this is after waiting almost two hours .
we should still get our dumb $ _num_ off .
it was freaking delicious .
great portions and fresh ingredients .
the baked brie was lacking in brie as the previous reviewers mentioned .
so our entire meal that day ended up in the trash .
love the community .
like _num_ minutes later he took our food order .
service is always prompt , even when i order togo .
worst sushi place , ever !
everything is well maintained and regularly cleaned .
they have good , fresh food served timely .
the biggest problem that i have with sky harbor is the layout .
i asked the server if the green beans were vegetarian and she confirmed .
there carne asada plate is my go to and it 's good .
this place is awesome !
what a shame !
great home-style korean food .
worst experience ever .
very pleased and look forward to going back .

we have always had great service too !
the cool thing was they had new exhibits and new activities .
great customer service .
great work and customer service .
friendly customer service , will definitely take my business back in the future .
the food handling in the kitchen is questionable .
what the hell is this ?
will be back !
there were no specialty cheeses or meats .
i recommend this place to anyone looking for cuban food in las vegas .
the customer service was great .
should n't have even delivered that desert .
the atmosphere of the restaurant is also quite weird .
thanks !
thanks for the suggestions .
just not very healthy because of the fried stuff on top .
it 's nice that the bar is separate from the dining area .
after i left , i noticed that there were scratch marks on the metal !

its decor is horrible .
the hallways smell as do the rooms and they are not clean at all .
i picked up a couple of nails in my tire over the weekend .
tee time at _num_ pm .
and the foods were not the best they could be consider the price .
this place has by far the best green chili in phoenix !
habib is great !
this company should not be allowed to be in business .
fresh fish daily , extremely wide variety of rolls .
the chairs were filthy ( food , dirt , bird poop ? )
it was excellent .
always a great evening crowd and friendly .
just a cool place , excellent variety !
i highly recommend this store .
and the food just was n't very good at all .
the `` move over '' sign is utterly ridiculous .
great spot that i look forward to going back to !
food is good service is very poor .
overall , a totally disappointing anniversary dinner !
fun !
it was ridiculous .
i love this place !
she gave me back a card wrapped in the receipt .
security here is always a negative experience .
no napkins and no utensils to eat the food .

body shop from hell !
amazing ribs and sauce .
they are simply sub-par and lack any real good burger flavor .
food was horrible .

these things are great for sharing .
best mexican food in the east valley !
... great job !
we had _num_ pedicures and _num_ full sets .
they are the best .
awful , place is dirty , all chairs have stains all over them .
and frankly , it seems like the worst scratches tend to show up afterwards .
pork chop was tasty as well .
loved it .
sticky floors , dirty tables , soda area a wreck - yuk !
only gave two stars because of his customer service .
i do n't have a day to just give them to wait .
you want quality , this is the place .

this place is disgusting !
my daughter loved the buffet .
nice , clean office and waiting area .
will return and recommend .
only gave it one star because the place was clean .
this is the best chinese food i have tasted in a long time .
in madison - and somehow one of the best kept secrets .
no purchase from me !
order the hot wings grilled and get treat of your life .
the food is delicious and i like how they always have some daily specials .
best pancakes .
lovely .
this spot is both good for the young and the older .
had another great experience getting my wife something special .
this is a very nice rv park .
decent beer specials .
incredible !
the grilled wings are the best , i highly recommend them !
the food is greasy and not in a good way .
paul was very nice and offered to give me a new one .
great school .
they fixed it while i waited .
it tasted okay , but not great .
wish i could give it less stars !
she made sure i had everything i needed !
i tried it again and was extremely satisfied .
i live about _num_ miles away and its never a problem .
there must be something about everything baking together that makes it taste so good .
anyway , the food is great .
they have a nice deck and are dog friendly .
the food was amazing .
the _num_ minute class length is perfect for my toddlers too .
awesome .
do n't waste your time .
the sauce was not hot , the bread was soggy .
my wife and i very much enjoyed our meal and the service .
i loved it !
this was such a let down .
would absolutely come back again and bring friends .
but the quality of the food it worth it !
nick and eric ( who was training ) did a great job serving us .
big mistake .
the food is not overly light but its always been fresh in my experience .
the venue was & still is beautiful , green and elegant !
not nice !
nothing special .
i 'm sorry , what ?
however , my most recent call to them will also be my last .
good food , better service .
it 's not worth it .
no one got sick and the service was good for what was .
he truly cares about you and the work he puts in .
i will be in no rush to return .
this girl is the sweetest employee i 've ever came across !
really excellent service .
decent cajun food at a descent price .
just came back for a visit and it 's still delicious .
this place has in equal parts , bad vibe and attitude .
good store .
dinner was good .
heck yeah i want some more of it .
good service , great food , ok prices ( hence the _num_ stars ) .
place your order inside then wait for it outside .

the service is appalling .
always reliable always good !
the food here is mediocre at best .
they also noticed that i had a nail in my tire .
awful , service awful and food is gross .
chorizo is amazing !
no integrity .
two thumbs up !
he indicated that he would find my phone and mail it to me .
i love this place !
thank you !
best dogs i 've had in the phoenix area .
the food is outstanding here .
best salads ever .
best eggplant parm around - and the garlic knots are just so yummy !
however the truth is this place is just going with sub par food .
horrible , horrible service .
she then gave me a number and told me to ask for steven .
a perfect ending to a meal .
outstanding .
the best trader joes i 've ever been to !
all of us were stuffed and happy !
can we say , `` rip-off ? ''
she was rude , very condescending and flat our a complete ignorant human being .
this is what they are good at .
the waiter that served us was really nice and friendly .
i find it to be very relaxing and comfortable .
tasted like zero effort went into making it .
that 's horribly annoying when i just paid _num_ bucks for both .
but they were the slowest movers i 've ever used .
this is more authentic .
in addition to the great food , the service was fantastic !
this will definitely be a place we frequent when we 're in vegas !
unfortunately we both left hungry .
it is perfect for a special occasion or just for a nice night out .
not bringing my friends nor family at macaroni grill .
i also asked for hot sauce , guess what i got instead ?
it 's a very beautiful and intimate resort .
really excellent service , good food and more than reasonable prices .
never going to stay at hyatt again .
i love dairy queen , but this location is awful .
antipasto sub took _num_ minutes to `` cook '' .
the best fish and chips i have ever had .
came back to this place for another time .
_num_ .
the food here is of very cheap quality .
but the sauce is great and so is the cheese .
they choose wrong and guess what ?
worth the drive to a sketchy area .
open to all !
the restaurant was so clean and neatly decorated .
i gave him the shock and it was sent in to fox .
love the beef bun , chicken pho and the egg rolls .
it was great !
i wish i had caught his name .
never returning again .
also , they 're open til 6pm !
i always look forward to going back .
the worst mexican food i have ever had .
there 's a dead fly in my fruit cup .
mediocre thai food .
my first try was with the meatballs and pasta .
the manager claims he is very helpful ?
servers are always very helpful and attentive .
why would n't someone call me instead of making me drive there ?
wrong !
breakfast is great !
checkin was seamless as it should be .
brunch menu is fantastic .
we love the food and the atmosphere !
very very nice .
i always bring my out of town visitors here .
good ingredients , lots of cheese and crispy crust .
i stayed here with my fiance for a night a couple of saturdays ago .
probably a big mistake on their part .
the atmosphere is wonderful , like a generous patio at someone 's home .
free kids meals on sundays and the options are great .
there were tables and servers ?
he arrived right on time and took the time to take care of us .
like a maze , though an easy maze as you wind through the exhibits .
worst wait staff and management i have ever experienced in my life !
i would only recommend it for take out food .
how rude !
i do n't see myself as picky .
is okay for what it is .
i feel bad for her .
he could n't breath .
they are so busy , service is terrible .
we would not come back here or encourage people to come here .
they have good quantity of veggies and protein to make a healthy meal .
awesome omelets , made to order , all day long .
they saved me !
it is so much fun to explore here .
again to horrible service .
tried this place for the first time today and it was wonderful !
they consistently exceed my expectations .
i never seen my wife get so sick in my life .

this is a poorly run business that could be turned into something great .
of course he refused .
great service and food .
nice outside bar area .
highly recommended !
i always manage to find everything i need here .
it was such a joke i just ate the fish sticks with my hands .
ashley was great !
i love this place .
the staff is always really friendly and the place is kept clean every time .
not only that but they gave me my car back filthy .
this place is awesome .
the food was good and plentiful .
a great place to go for german food !
he said `` what do you mean corporate - i am corporate '' .
they did n't .
i just hope she moves somewhere else .
my family loves this place !
right from the start i was impressed by this operation .
dirty and expensive .
they recently updated their menu , and it 's great !
very surprised they came from a chain restaurant .
they were very thorough with me as a new patient and welcoming .
especially disappointing was the mint chip .
pricey , but i was completely happy with my chosen entree .
always helpful staff .
bartender is extremely slow to prepare drinks .
_num_ minute wait .
been loyal customers since it opened .
unfortunately phoenix is slowly but surely returning to its roots .
all i asked for was sour cream and butter on the potato .
furthermore i week later i found my car 's belt system was broken .
there filet mignon is also very good as well as there ribs .
so thank you national for always being there for the business traveler .
i love this location .
best breakfast in west chandler !
he guaranteed that we would love our choices and we all did .
well i got ready to crawl in about _num_ pm .
this place has big portions at a great price !
david , the director of sales and catering , was a superstar !
there 's no pride in the service or the food at all .
this place just gets it right with quality .
the burgers , while being billed as `` big '' , are hardly that .
very bad food and very bad service .
lil commercial but i 'm still satisfied .
the dj ( tiny ) was great and the cake was amazing .
most recently , i got a birthday cake for my son 's birthday party .
it barely satisfied our craving for actual pizza .
probably wo n't be going here no more .
this location has been here forever , and it is worth going to .
the bagel was very good and chewy .
service was spotty and the food was so-so .
completely rude to me , my mom , and my son .
my enchilada was no better than any other enchilada i 've ever had .
not fresh , not flavorful , even the wasabi was bland .
i was surprised and impressed .
order it fresh with extra sauce and enjoy !
the honey lemon boba teas was excellent .
so there you have it .
come to find out they wo n't cover it either .
it 's fun .
really liked the lanes here .
best carnitas quesadillas ever .
great service , not crowded .
the chocolate calzone looked amazing .
my service today was outstanding .
but they ultimately overcharged me to the tune of double the quoted price !
pasta is amazing .
zach was an excellent waiter tonight !
i am never coming to this tropical smoothie again .
aside from that i 'd recommend it to spicy food lovers !
having several other patrons around would have made me feel more at ease .
will i get sick this time or not ?
good deal .
their shop rate is $ _num_ .
this place has gone down hill over the years .
waited _num_ minutes and still sitting waiting to be seen .
staff has always been very nice and helpful .
very comfortable bed and a great selection at the restaurant for breakfast and dinner .
i do n't get how this place is in business .
and then , they managed to lose our luggage .
i was very impressed .
then we had _num_ different kind of pho for our main entree .
did not want to hear any bad things about her .
she is very meticulous and did a wonderful job with my gel manicure .
not worth time , money or energy .
thank god for this place .
what a nightmare .
but the theatre is horrible !
great experience selling my gold wing on consignment .
hello , where 's my waitress ?
wow , i was disappointed .
for $ _num_ you can wash for _num_ minutes .
just all the way around an easy , convenient experience .
this pizza is very good and a reasonable price to boot .
on the cheaper end , very good food .
no testing of any kind that day .
yes , _num_ stars are very well deserved .
big waste of time and gas .
top of the line merchandise ... .
i highly recommend it !
they are huge hd fans .
i loved the upstairs lounge .
so i decided to run my car down to sun devil auto .
worst hospital ever .
service is always special .
boyfriend got the jack daniels pecan pie .
they also answered all my questions and took a lot of time with me .
she said she could n't do anything and did n't credit the difference .
i loved this place except for the limited choices .
the thai iced tea is definitely perfect .
very friendly and the shop was clean and welcoming .
the staff has been good and service pleasant also .
i am glad i discovered this place , and will definitely go again .
the staff is always friendly and provides excellent service .
i love this barber shop !
i wo n't be back again .
my kid is always happy going there .
overall a very pleasant buying experience .
great selection of cheeses .
terrible service !
this monday i found my car is dripping oil .
the asshole taking our order could 've be bothered with our order .
our rooms did not look vacuumed and the bathroom was not wiped down .
car looks great and is ready for the summer heat .
we went back to bartender again because she kept our valet and garage tickets !
some people like that i guess , but i avoid this place .
i love the deals i always find .
the fish filet hot pot is amazing .
our food took forever and when it got there i was highly disappointed .
one star is not low enough in my opinion !
you feel like you 're in a western town for sure .
the bartender was very nice and welcoming .
rude front desk staff .
some of the best donuts i 've had .
all the workers were extremely rude especially the lady workers !
good north and south indian food .
no ambiance .
the produce prices are phenomenal and fresh !
overall i 'm giving them a _num_ star .
one of our favorite places .
service is good .
excellent customer service !
really relaxing vibe .
i got a pedi and a fill with french manicure .
i have always had good food and service here .
this is our go-to date night dinner out .
does n't look like a lot , but is a good place .
very affordable and quick .
best rolls and freshest fish in the valley !
sometimes it 's watery .
boyfriend got a breakfast burrito , i got a shredded beef burrito .
great place to slip in to watch the game .
house takes tips from waiters then charges you again .
love their `` bowl of bolognese '' .
it 's gets very , very stuffy in there .
we ordered take out last evening from best wok .
the place is very clean and they seem to be very happy working here .
the mine tour was over priced and horribly boring and a waste of time .
it was really good !
friendly , funny and comfortable .
tucked away in the back of the plaza is a hidden gem .
the bread : perfectly salty , with a crunchy crust , and fluffy crumb .
these guys did a great job from start to finish .
got ta love this place .
great prices and very friendly staff .
this was almost the worse dining experience ever !
waited _num_ mins for tacos .
cold uncooked meat .
this was delicious !
it was cooked perfectly .
nice environment .
the background music was perfect as well .
the egg salad sandwich was ok.
i loved the ambiance just such a cute place with character .
no comparison between this one and rainbow .
plus they do a better job here !
the catfish was bland .
my family loves going here .
do n't remember exactly what i had but remember it was good !
best club sandwich i 've ever had !
best coffee in charlotte !
anyway , love it !
whiskey peppercorn sauce on the side was a nice addition .
it 's rather unfortunate it had to be a negative one .
we will definitely visit this location again .
we left with the hungry feeling gone but certainly no feeling of satisfaction either .
this place is a diamond in the rough and i love it !
the only good thing is that they have multiple campus locations .
my nails look no way professional , the service this last time was unacceptable .
wrong .
they probably would find a way to mess that up though .
washington , a great little hood and home of shiloh grill .
went here a couple weeks ago while i was in arizona .
the portion size is hit or miss .
avoid bell trans .
and the buns are super , too !
bottom line , we wo n't be back anytime soon .
caution !
paper plates and plastic utensils fit the ambiance , but food is excellent !
i love this place !
great donut selection and price !
good pricing .
they were really fast and efficient .
the food was n't terrible .
this is probably the best location in town .
the staff at this safeway is tremendous !
hostess was very awkward when seating us .
the food was amazing , service was impeccable and the view was just breathtaking .
no apology .
jimmy normally cuts my hair and he does a good job .
but i have wasted enough money at their restaurants .
so no explanation as we just sat there and continue to wait .
bed too close to wall .
i love to go to a family run place .
he makes us our own sushi rolls .
it just seems to have gotten sloppy and disappointing .
good food .
they were nice , helpful , honest and affordable .
but it looks like i 'll have to keep on passing on by .
when you first walk in it looks a little nicer then most salons .
also this is a clean , well-maintained location as well .
the pho was delicious and very authentic .
in _num_ years i have never had an accident .
it 's clearly a family owned restaurant .
it was decorated very nicely as well .
through the years , i still love .
bell trans would not credit my credit card .
thanks to a fellow yelper for introducing me !
friendly staff .

you 've been warned !
i truly appreciate the professional treatment , and friendly environment at acura of tempe .
made fresh daily .
i 'll make this one as easy as possible .
very courteous and classy place .
unfortunately , the sales people are pushy and rush you through the store .
the service here is always spot on , even during the busy lunch rush .
both were very fresh and had just the right amount of sweetness .
waitress said no problem .
the pizza is the best and it 's a pity they do n't deliver .
total waste of time .
it 's more of a family .
worst service ever !
pizza hut you should be ashamed !
the pieces were so small it looked like a quail .
friday night is apparently not the night to go .
great service .
amazing place and staff !
repeat visits are not very great .
i 'm not sure how anyone after eating here goes back .
$ _num_ plus two $ _num_ tips for one pizza and a small brownie ?
low pressure and she answered all our questions .
the spicy california roll is by far the best roll available .
i did see one lone maid 's cart but no maid .
it is by far my favorite place to go to eat .
as good as it gets !
the general tso 's chicken was over cooked .
it is so delicious that you ca n't resist .
i wanted them to , but they just did n't .
i have curry peanut salad , it 's good .
atmosphere , staff and coffee are the best .
checkout their rooftop as well .
i got a full body wax , she was efficient and fast .
i went with the farmer 's skillet and it was great .
great hot dogs .
perfect for a date night or a large group party .
then for the main course the homemade pasta was memorable and very delicious .
i enjoy this place .
i was in las vegas for the holidays and needed a fill .
zero stars .
i also love to buy my sushi making supplies here .
all of their teachers are not certified .
restrooms are not terribly clean , and in need of a major update .
the tempura shrimp is the best ... .
the shrimp and sides are great too .
the meat shop in the back offers some good selections for you .
it was my first time having fondue but it was worth every penny .
truly disgusted .
also i spotted a few homeless guys just outside sitting .
great job guys !

our dinner was excellent !
i was there to buy and the service ruined everything .

the ice-cream was really icy , the crunchy things were rock hard , etc .
great food , extremely attentive staff .
their menu has the usual mexican favorites and some good appetizers .
she said `` no we do n't do that .
saved us a lot of time and frustration !
many of us voted for artichoke hearts .
they have amazing people that help you find the perfect gift !
i 'm surprised how they could get their chicken so perfectly juicy .
the food is decent to above average .
lovely service .
the vegan ph soup is fantastic .
the corporate office needs to inspect this mcdonalds and remove the current management .
this mall is dead !
unfortunately , the rear window was just above our bed .
no call back .

i have never has such a excellent experience .
definitely worth a visit and good , straightforward family style restaurant in green valley .

the atmosphere is quaint and quirky .
fresh fish - the toro is to die for .
you 're best bet is their happy hour and groupon specials !
the service is wonderful here .
their meat was overcooked and flavorless .
i 'm tired of being treated like a dollar sign ... never going back .
no patio furniture on the patio , a little strange .
a lot of very interesting video material let us know more stories .
oh yeah !
great place to enjoy by kids and adults .
even better than lee lee 's !
the professional level of service is unmatched .
this was the best thai food i think i 've ever had .
my loyalty to southwest is constantly being tested .
when we got to the restaurant , it was a bit bland outside .
the best french dip i 've ever had .
the crust tasted pretty bland , a bit like cardboard .
rooms are super clean , service is super good .
so needless to say , this is no longer our vet .
great carne asada fries .
why could n't the employees at desert ridge do this ?
i 'm livid and would not return here if you paid me to !
this particular store has very friendly and never pushy staff .
more like a child care service with mediocre food .
none of this took place , of course .
gross .
i remember the tin angel of the 80s and 90s .
plenty of food and a nice variety .
great place !
it 's a great little cafe , with all kinds of options for everyone .

thanks to pink jeep tours for a memorable experience !
upon my return to chandler i will definitely be back !
not too impressed , to tell you the truth .
the meal also came with a sweet and ripe slice of pineapple .
food was gross .
the baristas here do a great job of making specialty coffees .
in fact the pad thai was so good , we ordered some to go .
rudest , most disrespectful server i 've ever had .
go local !
parking is a ripoff and all signs in the building are posted poorly .
great food at great prices with great service in a great atmosphere .

excellent happy hour special !
_num_ times this year _num_ business trips and one personal .
over the years , the interior has stayed clean and fresh looking .
talk about a great decision !
terrible service from beginning to end .
this place is so good .
right from the get go i was a little let down .
the beans were runny and the rice was also really bland .
the least they could do was substitute tenders in place of breast .
great diner -- breakfast , pie , milkshakes ?
i love this museum !
here 's the worse part .
it 's like the surface of the moon !
they are family owned and everything is very reasonable .
i would recommend this hotel .
she was aware i was short on time and did an amazing job .
so it 's a great place to go watch a sporting event with friends .
long story short i made the drive back so my kid got his food .

one of the best i have had .
the service was pretty good too .

super tasty lunch spot !
thanks !
very disappointed with my monday night bowling experience .
kendra takes so much care and is such a pro .
personally , i do n't think i 'll be coming back here again .
i do n't even know where to start with this bad experience .
beans tasteless and of course rice same thing .
he drove away and had to come back for his money .
i 'm sure at one time the place was trendy - it 's died .
i love this place !
do n't do it , not worth it .
dr. moore himself is upbeat and cracks jokes through out your appointment .
absolutely horrible .
the rest of the food was mushy and bland .
really just a waste of time and money .
like that 's my problem .
some friends and i went for happy hour on friday and really enjoyed ourselves .
jerry or tim will do a great job .
i really like it here and will continue to shop .
she gives the best deep tissue massage in all of vegas .
i have also tried the pasta , and enjoyed it .
a girl has to look good when she hits the gym .
i would n't recommend coming here .
i have no idea why i return to this location ... other than convenience .
the best vodka sauce and meatballs ever.
scratch that , that 's an understatement if i 've ever heard of one .
worth the hour drive for me !
great job guys keep up the good work !
there nachos are amazing as well .
they are always very friendly and helpful when i ask questions about the plants .
she is an amazing stylist .
ingredients seem pretty consistently fresh .
convenient , easy and friendly service !

bad !
horrible in fact !
food is good .

she had an amazing first day and actually enjoyed it !
this is my fianc and i 's favorite place for steak !

highly disappointed on all levels .
he also is a kind man .
i will not make the mistake of going here again .
service is fast and servers are attentive and friendly .
i love the trendy look and the food .
best jazz open mic i 've ever seen .
a tiny bit pricey , but worth every penny .
will not come back .
thank you luis , you 're awesome !
great place tucked away by the lake !
the service is average too , nothing really special about it .
service was excellent , food too .
when he gave me the bag i saw no chili .
highly recommended if you are looking for some good down home comfort food !
that was not a good scene and i barely touched food .
_num_ pieces of clothes for $ _num_ at _num_ % off .
sorry , cobblestone .
instead of telling me that they did back fills , she took them off .
great location and beautiful music .
great booths for sitting in with a few friends .
absolutely blown away by this place .
very professional .
it was n't anything spectacular as that can be ordered just about anywhere .
an amazing value at about $ _num_ !
steelers fans are the best !
peter piper pizza has better food than this place .
this is one of my favorite stores .
it can become quite dirty and cluttered as the night goes along .
great prices and knowledge of the older stuff .
i would definitely not recommend this place to anyone .
it was typical buffet sushi , poor quality and covered in mayonnaise .
thirty one minutes later , i was taken back to a room .
but only because it 's closer than chipotle .
well worn ( or should i say bad worn ) .
slowest drive through starbucks on planet earth .
the staff is very friendly too .
the salon is clean and the staff is always very friendly .
i am not a huge fan of italian dressing and prefer ranch .
the staff there is pretty great as well .
absolutely ridiculous must have over booked themselves .
i do not recommend this place .
fine whatever , so i got a bean and cheese burrito .
i took one bite and i was done .
it came with very delicious pico de gallo and red and green salsa .
and the hospital itself was dirt and careless .
if i were to go back , it certainly would not be to eat .
great service & scrumptious food .
i arrived two minutes late , checked in and sat down .
just love it so much !
wrong again .
always friendly !
the few sushi entrees that we have tried have been very tasty and fresh .
i was totally impressed - they made the whole experience fun .
have to say the service and food were very good .
the tortilla was overcooked as well as everything else inside .
the staff were very personable and friendly .
overall , a good experience .
the place smelled like _num_ years of smoking went on in there .
sale signs are n't clear .
the same guy is always there and is friendly .
amazing !
do not waste your time !
so finally i tried it and it 's great !
not vegan friendly .
the plants available are all big , healthy and reasonably priced .
also , this is a great place for breakfast .
i 'm so happy to have found this company .
the total was like _num_ bucks .
food is fantastic and _num_ % authentic .
_num_ .
their mild salsa was old and mushy !
i 'm in heaven .
very tasty , good sized wings .

tasty food at a decent price .
everyone needs a good mechanic you can trust .
very good and fresh .

this cvs has a nice layout and has friendly employees .
he really looks out for your best interest .
great .
best quality deal in town .
awful place .
it 's hit or miss with this place , but mostly a miss .
spendy no doubt but if you have the chance , this is a must .
lots of tv 's though .
i absolutely love it !
there were _num_ of us .
try it , it 's worth it !
my first dental visit in years and they were the best !
probably wo n't be coming back here anymore .
tacos , crispy , fresh , good flavor .
the food was great.
the food is fantastic .
the room was large , clean , and very comfortable .
i had the bbq tacos with their coleslaw and it was so so good .
very courteous service and just one of those bars that become your regular .
big huge mistake .
i love fresh wasabi !
service is always great and so is the food !
steak fajitas are amazing ( marinated meat ) .
it is the same fee to completely severe ties with the company .
hugh servings and the waitress was fantastic .
so , out of the blue there 's a fee after a few months .
alway worth the drive to decatur .
a bit pricey , but good food and huge portions .
avoid !
great pizza and even better service .
this is the first time i ordered prime rib here .
