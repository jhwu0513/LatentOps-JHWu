excellent staff , comfortable , quiet rooms at a reasonable price .
it 's great !
tried the bread pudding this weekend ... phenomenal !
my wife ordered some shrimp pasta dish , not alfredo .
first , they wo n't honor the internet price .
that place would be 1/2 empty while panda express would have long lines .
that made no sense and took away from the relaxation .
i did n't like the food it was dry .

i can automatically smell the tuna .
but when i finally sat down to do my nails it was a disaster !

pours are generous , and there 's a fantastic selection to choose from .
i 've seen the process of the drink and it 's not rocket science .
brian would not return our calls .
i also ordered some macarons to take home .
i tried to return a tool that failed .
they have a great bar area at the front of the restaurant .
i feel very comfortable with my older mom living alone at river ranch .

this hotel is not one of them .
highly recommend the white widow and the jamaican ' both sandwiches are amazing !
a must stop for the best food and service in vegas .
shame shame shame , did i say shame ?
love being able to see so many options in one place .
oh , and there is no air conditioning .
i gave them plenty of chances to just fix it ... .

give it a try and thank me later .
for what it is , best i 'd say in this area !

that 's why i ask you to please tell me what i 'm missing .
find another resort !
cool joint to hang out outside and relax .

i keep telling myself to branch out but they 're such perfect lunches .
host never greeted me and was around the corner talking with co-workers .
first of all , not sure why this is called a `` resort . ''
great customer service !
Negative
the problems started at check-in when my room was n't ready .
i love it here and i 'm so glad i found this place .

always polite workers & music .
poor service .
also , staff was very patient , helpful , and friendly .
just love how my nail needs are always taken care of .
there were no complaints with the chicken , the only star of this evening .
this hospital is just a money making scam .
even when it 's free .

love the honey toast .
what a great knowledgeable staff .

does n't this place know that every other rental place is more efficient ?
this med spa truly offers the best of both worlds .
friendly service great people and an enjoyable environment .
it 's pretty hard to mess up a pizza as simple as a margherita .
this place is so delicious !
she helped us set it up !
the sandwich was a good size though and took half of it home .
a little gem .
not worth it at all .
i would like to give it a higher rating but just ca n't .
it might seem out there , but boy is it worth it .
so i had a va appt that was scheduled for me to go here .
very clean and comfortable .
they did a very good job on both .
some of the language was suspect , but other than that it was great !
first , it is small , smaller than it lets on .
i ordered street tacos and they were an absolute joke .
they are worthless !
i do n't even think the bacon is worth coming here for .
it was all amazing !

the owners were great !
they even had me laughing !
they will do their best to help .
food was pretty good .

i was so overwhelmed ( in a good way ) .
well , i completely agree with tina !
mmmmm ... steak .
the baristas are awesome and the coffee is great .
and she did a great job !
where is the santa fe omelette ?
we had n't even looked at a car yet .
i cant stress how good this shop is .
awesome experience !
when we arrived to the room , there was a significant chemical smell .
so gorgeous .
that ca n't be good for business .
again , this was my experience with quality inn and suites .
this place has superb food at great prices .

if i could give negative stars , i would .

very professional guys who seemed to have regulars they called by name .
it 's not great but i 've come to love it .
the staff is friendly and the store is clean .

we split the chopped salad with gorgonzola .
there were _num_ other people in the store and they were looking around .
great spot to pick up something for a dinner party !
way good prices .
my worst fear of not ordering or having enough food has happened !
if you want it done right , go to habib 's !
as mentioned below , this is a great hidden spot .
i went here the other night and it was a fairly not awesome experience .
but tonight was not that case .
overall great place to eat .
clean , friendly , get what you paid for kind of deal .
soup was mediocre .
this dentist and his office manager have the worst customer service skills .

i like red robin but not this location .

my favorite asian restaurant in madison .
we ended up having the best time !
the food is mediocre at best .
great pizza !
lots of interesting brownies and pastries !
every employee is extremely nice , polite , and very helpful !
it 's sorta crammed in the end of a parking lot .
for a small local eatery it is very fresh and very good .
they have specials only on sundays which are always so delicious .
fresh sushi every day too .
however the employees here are extremely sweet especially holly !
gets a major `` skip it '' rating from me .
dr. v made us feel confident in his expertise and explained the surgery well .

he said they were very disorganized when he was there , bad service .
we went for the beer specials , which were good .

she made me feel totally comfortable and was super kind .
the inside is okay !
love it !
got a great cut with daniel .
all 's i can say is tony 's back !
super casual upstairs lunch joint on state street .

this place is totally madison rich people food .
every time i 've been here , i 've been unsatisfied .

great place for outdoor lunch , great service , great food !
one of the nicest malls i 've ever been to .
the food was alright except for my sisters food .
they have the best patio ever out back .
i can put up with a lot of things for a cheap dinner .
what a sweet way to end a day on the south side !
a cool pub serving authentic english dishes .
the owner made everything extremely awkward from basically the moment that we sat down .

good value , freshly prepared , friendly service , great menu variety !
any other einstein 's is better than this one .
our consultant did n't pull any dresses for us .
the service is amazing , the staff are very attentive .
its worth a trip just to read the signs and bumper stickers .
otherwise , it is annoying .
wish there was a choice of no stars .
the bad : raw oysters were frozen .
great donuts !
a terrible experience .
the accompanying mashed potatoes were also quite cold and lumpy .
i did not , however get the best .

great little family owned restaurant .
great place to watch games as they are covered wall to wall with televisions .
nice size bar and lots of beers on tap !
loved the artistic theme !
best sushi guys ever .
great store .
everything in the store smells amazing !
tsa security is the worst .
i will not be going here again .
why do they call it jiffy lube ?
i will definitely go back and try their other dishes .
we had no ice bucket , not enough towels and the window was open !
it 's more like a group cafeteria setting but comfortable .
i explained that i was pissed .
the burritos are good , servings are huge .
it 's really great to find these foods in phoenix .
loved it .
stopped by this bbq joint while in vegas , loved the food !

nice relaxing atmosphere !
your sister should not be your receptionist .

the place is run down it def .
the food is amazing .
could n't even get silverware without asking even after food was on the table .
this is the best i 've had so far , by far !
california eggs benny is one of our favorites .
the only good thing i can say is the chips were good .
no lauren .
very reasonably prices in the heart of town !
i thought the food courts were nice and spacious .
such a great restaurant !
nice stay although hotwire hit me w extra fee for resort fee .
i agree that this place is underrated .
and of course the beer was good and very well priced .
unfortunately , i do n't agree with their choice .
mind you , i was totally alone .
they claimed i needed a new radiator and quoted approximately $ _num_ .
friendly service , small restaurant .
just got back from having breakfast with the girls !
sorry , but i do n't recommend and never will .
the vets , however , can be really pushy .
habib is fantastic !
hands down , this is my favorite sushi spot .
it was delightful .
signage is good .
i also liked the fact where the hotel was located .
perfection !
it 's just mushy .
went here for my one of my anniversary meals and we loved it .
it 's a great place to see a $ _num_ band at any rate .
they are very effective and helpful and i have always felt welcome .
his suggestions were great !
however , the attention makes up for the cost !
too much salt !
i do n't know the food well enough to take huge chances .
probably never will .
i loved it here and i will be coming back !
the best part was they only changed a minimal fee for the service .
the greek salad is a great accompaniment with its homemade balsamic vinaigrette .
the office staff & maintenance are the worst i have ever dealt with .
this place is amazing !
great prices , great food , quick service !
they finally had to tape something white to it .
one visit was too many .
really liked the mexican pizza .
service was good .
service is very fast and friendly .
this is a good mexican food restaurant !
i kid you not .
i really like this bar .
great dinner !
the ambience ... rather superb .

the salad had wilted leaves and there was jello all over the floor .
a great dive bar to hang out .
fast seating , good service .
dustin is a very skilled specialized tech with great customer service skills .
i love pizza but was really disappointed with this place .
as usual , let 's start with the bad news .
the open salsa bar with _num_ distinct flavors : very wonderful .
good steak fries .
fifteen years and i 'm still a happy customer !
i bring family and friends and will continue .
this place was so delicious and i ca n't wait to go back .
the food is delicious !
their roasted eggplant is very good .
they did an excellent job with the entire spread .
the fresh rolls were also quite delicious .
right now there is the manor twin , and this place .
great ( and endless cups of ... ) coffee .
best sandwiches in town .
the rice was too dry , and there was barely any flavor .
i found a property online that i fell in love with .
the machaca burritos are amazing too .
before you attempt to shop here , know your prices .
hope this helps .
no one would have ever known the difference .
you can go out once and have no desire to ever go out again .
the girls there are incredibly rude and incompetent .
i had a great time here last night .
lots of good memories in this restaurant .
the girls that were working today we 're all very nice and friendly .
good selection of beers , i don ; t care about wine !
they check everything so that is always a plus .
highly recommended .
loved this place .
great time for dinner .
highly recommended !
i love this very friendly and homey place .
ugh .
well the tacos at cabo are delicious !
the menu is large with a lot of choices .
unlv is heading in the right direction .
secondly , they do n't clean the tables too often .
the cashier would n't even look at me or respond to my question .
the food is seriously lacking .
so susan the ma set me up with an appointment that night at 6pm .
lee 's is a quality liquor store .
our office will not call or order from you again !
love love love this place !
what a waste of $ _num_ bucks for the food i got .
not fresh at all , tasted like it was day old .
the cashier is so sweet and the food is always great .
very good overall - i will be back !
bad service .
good guy to small talk with too .
big restaurant but great service .
the pharmacy , however , never seems to have anything in stock .
our servers have all been nice and familiar with the menu .
food was pretty good and atmosphere was nice .
unfortunately , we probably wo n't be back .
she simply took his weight down , & placed us in a room .
relaxed atmosphere .
our appetizer was served by a runner and another runner served our entrees .

i have been here several times now and i definitely like it .
my favorite spot for breakfast in madison !
my experience did not turn out well .
great fried chicken and blackened meatloaf , and the best fried oysters on earth .
the food is excellent .
i support small businesses but never again will i even walk in that place .
_num_ .
walk away .
we found this place by chance , thank goodness .
this is a sad excuse for a business .
we did , and i am happy that we did so .
i buy balloons and cards for special events here .
always use the bathroom and it 's always clean .
service is friendly and timely bringing out your food .
on my way home i noticed there was no sauted mushrooms i ordered .
the selections and prices are great .
we were seated and ordered our drinks and all was well .
the price is right the people and service are extraordinary .
i wish i could give less than one star .
we hope they keep their success and grow !
the facility is old and rundown and the staff is n't very helpful .
definitely a great choice for some good southern food that is n't too expensive .
sausage and pepperoni pizza was delicious !
it was very good .
everything we have tried is great .
went here awhile ago to get a cut with a barber i was recommended .
lobster bisque ... great homemade soups ... bagel sandwiches and wraps are very good.
it was kinda messy but so worth it !
and eva bartender pretty great too !
the risotto was undercooked and had no flavor .
these guys were great .
my husbands bone in rib eye was a tasteless overcooked disaster .
my husband ordered a _num_ vintage red from the wine list .
dana at acura service of tempe is without a doubt the best .
the meat is sweet , and reminds me of snow crab , just bigger !
well be back .
will not be going back !
even the vet technicians were sympathetic and made me feel comfortable .
the lunch sandwiches and soups are hearty and well-made .
if you want good authentic food this is the place !
nor would we still be unsatisfied after a 2nd counter tops was installed .
burger was big tasty and messy .
fantastic service !
the fish was definately frozen and overcooked , chewy and lacking flavor .
this whole foods is our favorite one in this area .
the bread is freshly made ; the marinara pasta sauce just perfect .
the staff is wonderful ... very friendly .
this hotel is fantastic !
excellent breakfast !
thank 's for the great service !
there are a lot of places to sit inside .
tuna sandwich is my favorite !
it was n't me .
during my visit , they were also offering a new cocktail on special .
the worst !
$ _num_ for a nail trim is ridiculous !
it is safe , family-friendly with nice green areas and pool .
you can tell they love their job !
this place really disappointed me .
the employees are friendly , helpful and curteous .
this is honestly the best nail salon in the valley !
they go above & beyond !
trick or treat .
thanks to all the staff for all you do for us .
best steakhouse i 've ever been to .
the reason why i rate this place low is the atmosphere is abysmal .
it was such a disappointment since i heard it was so good .
the food was delicious , all of us thought so .
overall though i was so let down and would not return .
awesome course .
i will not go here again .
the rooms were very nicely designed and provided a ton of space .
highly recommend !
as a customer i really do n't care .
the flavor was fabulous on everything that each of us tasted .
this outback needs a total overhaul !
cute place in phx to eat .
even better : it 's free with the meal !
also great as hangover food , and for lining your belly before a party .
you are better off with burger king .
i tried one of the lunch bowls : pepper steak .
good guys here !
i would n't get it again .
here 's a place that is a good all around theater .
the squash casserole and the sweet potatoes are also quite good .
food is great .
this is a fantastic nursery , with beautifully arizona grown plants and trees .
obviously , they do not follow orders nor listen to your requests .
great for the whole family .
the food is standard bar quality fare and the wings and burgers are meh .
the whole place seems like a free for all with no authority .
the team is professional , nice and courteous .
so yummy !
this is a cute starbucks , nice staff , pretty speedy service .
odd menu , poor choices , poorly presented .
perfectly cooked .
i think i 'm done giving them a chance and my money .
fried to die for .
overall shitty experience , bland food and overpriced menu .
if you never had korean bbq before this is a great place to start .
i would n't even take them if they were free !
1st it reeks of cigarettes .
i was frustrated and just left .
the coffee here is atrocious .
it would have been an expensive job , too .
- plus they have no clue how to run a restaurant .
only if i could give this place negative stars .
this was after waiting over an hour for hamburgers and hotdogs !
the service was great when i picked up the truck .
really need to put some money into this place .
great people .
the prime burger was absolutely amazing !
one of the best sub places in the area .
left before we could try food .
very impressed with the front desk ladies as well !
everything here is great !
terrific food , clean dining area , and friendly customer service .
our food was cold and they use frozen patties for burgers .
the last two times they 've provided a dreadful experience .
i 'll help you , this place is bad .
all the great things about trader joe 's are to be found here .
but well worth it for the wings .
tyler promises the world ... then you never hear from him again !
worst pharmacy .
i absolutely hate this urgent care .
what a waste of time .
complete chaos as soon as you walk in the door .
thank you so much !

great indian food !
residential twice per week pickup ; however , only one day is actually provided .
i return after _num_ days .

no one finished their meal .
this past week the apartment below us was broken into .

you have no idea how badly i want to like this place .
best place to watch football on the weekends !
i will be back !

i would n't recommend this place at all ... .
the noodles were a little dry .
with _num_ kids that age - we barely got in _num_ games .

first and last !
time to be seen and then you feel like you are rushed out .
our waiter was very generous , unfortunately i forgot her name .
the guac is n't good .

had dinner here with my husband the other night and was very happy .
well sadly the prior visit seemed to be the par that has been set .
i am still waiting _num_ days later for a return call .
i should have went to the big irish bar instead .
great service , amazing italian cuisine and definitely a strong , loyal following .
i did n't leave a tip for probably the second time in my life .
why did n't i get paid then ?
i crave it .
it lists the top ten ice cream shops in america .
terrible !
so ridiculous .
whatever it is , it is amazing .
great beer choices .
the staff is extremely friendly and helpful as well .
very , very happy with that level of customer service .
this property just needs to be torn down .
great attention to detail and quick as well .
the front desk has no customer service skills after you check-in .
parking on the street is a bit tight , but its definitely worth it .
veal is free range veal that was bland , dry somewhat tough and tasteless .
extremely disappointed in this company .
food poisoning is awful .
i guess the worst part of the meal was the fries and hushpuppies .
my waiter was obviously overworked .
but if the customers cared about good coffee , they would not go here .
love it .
the airport is bright and clean and offers lots of shopping and dining options .
i 'm also pretty sure the dr got my prescription wrong .
great hot food !
as good as it gets customer service wise .
thumbs up !
the staff is very rude .
no luck after driving a good _num_ miles no reset .
my wife and i had a great meal there last night .
Negative

one of my favorite vietnamese restaurants in the valley !
quite beautiful , challenging , fair and really well maintained .
excellent place for subs , cool joint to chill too .
we loved the atmosphere and the personalized customer service we received from the owner .
checked the beds right away when we checked in .
despite his initial rudeness , i invited him in .
they are always so helpful !
the operator told me to wait for a call from the technician .
it should have been more like a salad and less like a mayo spread .
gorgeous sunset people running around to their flights .
a little pricey , but worth it !
the office told me to come in right away .
_num_ . )
go and enjoy !
& i have sampled most of it !
but the last few visits sure were disappointing .
i looked around saw only _num_ tables with patrons with 4-5 restaurant staff .
regardless of the fact that we did n't eat it that 's still disgusting .
this may be the worst mcdonalds in charlotte .
hopefully another will come around .
in the end , my feet feel and look great .
good selection of imported stuff .
shame on autonation toyota .

could hardly hear each other .
there are many tables and chairs with free wifi .
wish i could them better , but not impressed .
my friend enjoyed his gyro wrap & falafel .
these guys are great .
the food here is pretty good but not the best i 've ever had .
definitely worth a try if you are in the area !

the taco meat was n't even ground beef .

great place with dim lights and incredible wines and food .
super fast , very organized and they are all extremely friendly .

this place is just a very basic , no frills cafe .
their customer service while i was at the store was impeccable .
they staff there is extra friendly and the store is clean .
service was ok at first but our server soon lost interest in our table .
fried dumplings were way too doughy and the sauce was way too bland .
the girls working there were really nice !

the service is friendly and never keeps you waiting too long !
i use to enjoy the chicken delight , now i order the carne asada .

no management presence .
this place has the best chicken wings in town .
absurd !
service was amazing and friendly .
friendly and helpful servers , too .

i do n't get why it 's consistently busy .
i would not recommend it to anyone .
i went down there and dropped off the car .
i was in a time crunch , so paid anyways .
the sandwiches were not good at all .
needless to say , we are beyond angry at how we were treated .
what was truly terrible was the service and the ambience .

you walk into the cramped ( otherwise cozy ) restaurant .
we went for a date night and it was fun .
there are two things i can not stand : bad service and parking tickets .
enjoy !
best place for middle eastern supply .

slow on the water refills .
we ordered the `` what is that '' roll and it was perfect !
it 's quiet and we get excellent service .
it was cold and old food .
first impression ... you come in and the place looks tired .

i said , `` just bring me another '' and then never brought one .
o and thanks to erin that made our time there awesome .
the waitress was cool !
service is terrible .

just stopped for a beer .
pedi and mani were quick and she got the job done !
the atmosphere is much more intimate .
i think the place has gone downhill .
horrible !
the appetizer was stuffed mushrooms that were served ice cold .
price of labor is more than fair .
i tell him and he says `` i do n't have that . ''
that 's a definite no .
i really love the food .
_num_ ) they dont know how to control their fire alarm system at 5am .
do n't worry about it being in the mall , it 's worth it .
it 's a family business that really cares about their customers .
do n't be so surprised if they book you somewhere else later .
a job well done !
i filed a report with the police .
if you ever come here for breakfast i recommend you try the western sandwich !

it is one of my favorite places to eat .
so that 's a good experience .
i walked over to the kitchen to tell the manager we were leaving .

good server .
so they replaced it with a large fries .
she made this clear _num_ times .

_num_ star for food .
crooks , if i could get this place shut down i would .
they had some nice quality items , however , it was quite pricey .
i love the mushroom steak cheese sandwich with crispy fries and a drink .

i always went for very basic services ( routine cleanings ) .
they have the best pie i 've had for decades !
excellent food , burgers are quality fresh meat , soups are good .
anyway she 's awesome .
no one here i 'm waiting waiting .
_num_ plus min .

i love my az sun screens !
_num_ .
nice find in the point breeze neighborhood .
i am very disappointed .

the new york strip is their best steak .
this place just refused service .
excellent job smoky jon 's !

drinks will take you _num_ minutes .
2pm on a thursday could not even be bothered to answer back a hello .
i will definitely go back again ( hopefully better prepared next time ) !
outstanding !
the price is worth it .
yet another friend loves their pumpkin pie .
the only thing the servers did was bring out water and our pho .
they also have burgers and shakes .
sesame chicken was great !
my pho was not really good .
great ambiance .
everyone was so nice !
wonderful family-owned cleaners who saved my clinic jackets for school !
i will definitely be back for all of my jeweler needs !
the light rail makes it incredibly easier to get to as well .
- the food tastes so-so .
they did a terrific job on my hair .
_num_ star service with very good and competitive prices .
one of the worst major airports .
try it .
so its probably a walking fest pool _num_ % of the year .
no one seems to care .
i was not overly impressed .
april his front office assistant makes everyone feel at ease .
i do n't need a rude , stuck up vet !
also the salad is n't great .
moon valley has done a great job and julie is the best !
finally , i switched doctors to another group out of frustration .
the food was delicious real mexican food !
not a good meat to veggie to tortilla ratio .
but no , i wo n't be going back there .
the customer service here is great !
i would definitely recommend these guys .
she was not worth _num_ % .
the service is always good .
volcano chicken was delicious .
price - as mentioned , decently priced .
sadly , none of that is true now .
slow .
a treasure on spring mt .

we had the lunch special and it was not real seafood .

they fixed my car fast and they did a great job .
all in all delicious dinner .
there are probably _num_ spots and most of them fill up pretty quickly .
the driver was very nice and courteous but that 's where the positives end .
the phone was in perfect shape and having major battery drain .
but here 's the thing , i have .
the employees seem slow , stupid , and lazy .
when i asked for more i was given such an attitude .
great breakfast joint .
very good man drinks , very good lady drinks .
great hours .
slow and horrible .
plus i really liked the lucky cat statues at the registers .
the bread and salads and soups are great .
yah , does n't work for me .
this walmart was unusually clean and stocked plenty of goods .
it 's incredibly clean and a comfortable park to relax or exercise in .
i know they have good fresh bread and other ingredients .
and it was cold - did n't even take my winter coat off .
worst photo department i have ever seen .
i highly recommend moon valley and bruce miller + team !
from the perfect hand cut fries to the over the top burgers .
i definitely thought it was important to note that .
i , unfortunately , did not have a positive experience with any of these .
he arrived and was also unable to open the door .
too bad .
online , their women 's haircut price is quoted at $ 30+ .
this place has it 's own personality !
our party arrived about _num_ minutes before our 5:30 reservations .
they will have my business going forward !
holy crap , this place is horrible !
best assortment of chocolate i have ever seen !
still , totally fun place .
we absolutely love our tattoos and will be coming back .
nothing memorable , and will not miss this place much .
because when you want fast food , an extra _num_ minutes is nothing .
the staffs are super friendly !
i wish i could remember her name .
the hubby was not happy .
i 'm very torn about this place .
the small spring roll was a nice little touch and very good !
not even a week later the car stops working again !
if you have n't been to big lots , you should check it out .
bread is something i would come here again for !
the guy waiter was not much nicer .
you were warned .

`` you bit into the wings , so no refund . ''
do n't waste your vacation time ( or money ) with their games .

the steak was not sirloin quality and the shrimp smelled and tasted badly .
the prices might be a little higher , but the service is good .
_num_ % recommend .
it was smooth and creamy and the whipped cream was lightly whipped just perfectly .
great burgers and fries ... .
my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh .
that combination is so delicious .
everyone was polite but i just could n't sit and wait any longer .
i was in town on business and they had great rates for the location .
my nails were n't too thick and they look natural for sure .
fun atmosphere , mediocre service , good ( not great ) food .
my mom , stepped in between us to stop .
they were fantastic !
they ruined our shopping day .
their mashed & baked potatoes are good , so is the coleslaw .
they were n't even freshly made chips !
but getting water refills or even a couple of forks was an ordeal .
everything was very beautiful .
and normally i never get sick to my stomach .
the lady who runs the office is unpleasant and rude .
dated but reasonably clean .
i was treated with respect and care .
i had chicken of the angels , and it was very salty .
nice crew and very professional .
food is outstanding .
so amazingly fresh and an incredible taste .
great food , pleasant service , amazingly affordable food .
went to purchase a beer brewing kit that he tried to overcharge me on .
especially bus # _num_ !
it was bad ... the you ca n't drink it kind of bad .
this is the largest cockroach i have ever seen in my life .
the restaurant was dated and the food quality was not the best either .
does n't mean that zinc bistro ca n't be unique .
first time my wife and i came here the service was awful !
hell , i 'm the one paying for the visit !
just goes to show you can get what you like here !
terrible selection , rude !
my family had all different cuts of fish and they were all prepared expertly .
this is by far the best dry cleaner i 've found in the area .
so overall my experience fell short due to the staff more than anything else .
the yelpers helped me out again .
horrible motel !
the place is always clean and everyone is very pleasant .
i will not be going to this place again and neither should you .
fantastic !
by then , i was almost finished with my meal anyway .
owners are very nice and friendly .
on a scale of 1-10 ( spice ) .
so i left it and walked out .
!
my stylist also was not good at placing the highlights .
frankly , i thought it was terrible .
we should have taken it as a sign and walked out .
this is not a fancy , trendy place , but they do good work .
i highly recommend him as a dentist !
i rarely give bad reviews , but this was a pretty horrible food experience .
the staff is very friendly and helpful too .
they really live up to their motto a miracle in the desert .
fun atmosphere .

we get the salads and app right away which was mediocre at best .
you must come to this specific location !
nine of us attending a trade show went and it was awesome !

it was terrible and it did not sit well with my stomach .
great place !
great hotel that would be excellent for family get away .
shes very helpful with the menu and giving us her opinion .
not this place !
more filling and it is a little cheaper .
needless to say , i did n't paint here .
she 's very thorough and so artistic .
i stopped in just because i was in a hurry .
their prix fixe menu gives almost unbelievable value on truly fine eats .
everyone loved what they ordered .
the shining stars here are the owners and clerks .
the food is really good as well and my gosh the portion !
this place is slow beyond belief .
the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating for our family of _num_ .

this is my second time renting from hertz .

my favorite is the mango , but it 's seasonal .

renting a car here is ridiculous .

we have not had domino 's because of a bad experience years ago .
but occasionally you can find something .
they only safe heaven are the waiters .

great place for buying fruit and nuts .
i 'll spend my money where it 's welcome .
it 's hard to find a good chinese place .
staff was friendly and got the bike running in great condition .

the location is so close to home and the staff was extremely friendly .
the absolute rudest staff possible .
this location is open early for breakfast which is nice .

great food and the service is some of the best !
i tipped too ( because i usually always tip ) but this is unacceptable !
always fill the drinks to the very top .
just hop out the car and run inside and get your food and leave .
management is a complete joke .
best smoothie place near uptown charlotte that i 've been to .
ugh , wal-mart , the store i love to hate .
would never return if i did not have to .
not worth eating out .
the rest of the staff is pretty cool too .
if i went back , i would only get the salad .
but it was room temp and runny .
probably one of my favorite places to go and get a nice burger .
i loves the shape of my nails and they lasted a very long time .
they had three chances to get it right , and struck out every time .
the video game selection new or used is impressive .
great haircut for $ _num_ + tip !

the potato salad and slaw appears store bought and not homemade .
food always great !
great customer service .
it was over $ _num_ dollars !
their results are amazing !
this place is just horrible and should be closed down .
i had the tuna melt and thought it was very good .
they just do n't show wear .
they have decent lunch specials that make eating there affordable as well .
i asked for short and she would not cut more .
the `` sundaes '' taste great .
the kitchen made me two incredible veggie tacos complete with a side of rice .
overall it was a great place and my kids really enjoyed it !
i will be back !
best of all is the woman that works here .
not very busy , but yet waited forever for our drinks .
they brought me a basket with one piece of chicken breast cut in half .
he was not missing that tooth .
stopped in for lunch at 12:30 and the place was dead .
the cookies were really good .
we ordered four appetizers to split and all of them were delicious .

the beignets with cream and berry sauces are amazing .
we like the strong vietnamese coffee .
next day picked it up with a very good price .
i do not recommend everybody to come .
always excited for a meal here !
yes this is also a con because i threw it away .
the music was great , the people and atmosphere where great !
then the people that change the food out do n't even wear gloves .
the hash browns were really good , but be prepared for a peppery kick .
thanks so much vicky !
slowest deli department in town .
last fall my husband had a terrible experience with this hotel .
we ordered salads , soups , a sandwich and a chicken breast meal .

_num_ .
it is the best new york style pizza in the valley !
unless i have some special need , i will be shopping elsewhere .
not good .
but it 's so good that you ca n't stop eating it .
such a refreshing good hole-in-the-wall place off the strip .
that is a beautiful thing now that parking downtown is so expensive .

the staff are very friendly and knowledgable about pool maintenance .
love love love the salon ... .
i love zia .
: / i would not go back here .
buon gusto !
i love this location !
do they charge everyone $ _num_ for a simple mani/pedi ?
i had loud , obnoxious residents around me .
the cashier was snotty when questions were asked and not very helpful .
their pad thai is outstanding .
i 've scheduled appointments and waited hours even after the fact .
it was truly insane behavior .
the bloody marys were very good as well .
they always do a real good job .

decent spot to get a bite to eat with some friends .
service was good as well .
i probably should have because i 'm still completely offended .
i always favor a place that has a tasty ipa on tap .
how frustrating is that .
my boyfriend and i decided to eat at subway yesterday evening around 11:30 pm .
delicious mother 's day brunch !
the tuna is fresh and the rice is very flavorful .
never going back and telling everyone how bad this place is .
love this place .
our server had a horrible attitude .
the waiter could n't have cared less when we complained .
i really ca n't imagine what could be making it so slow here .
a great vegas tradition ... it helps that i love frozen custard .
delicious and a wonderful experience !
i love the atmosphere here .
just random workers checking on us and apologizing .
he took the time out to talk to us and was very informative .
i come here about twice a month and enjoy it every time .
definitely stop by if you 're headed to the south side !
as well as sent many friends and family and will continue to do .
it was a scary experience with people smoking , yelling & throwing batteries around .
not very noticeable from the parking lot .
i called the airport , the airlines , no one could do anything .
it 's also a great place to have a few cold ones with friends .

a big , comfortable place which has a great decor .
the tortilla soup was way over seasoned - could not eat it .
not to mention the coffee was burnt !
they have free wifi , which is a bonus .

their food is very , very good , though .
the employee did n't say anything , but went to the back .

the savory scone was great and some other items were good- not quite fantastic .
amazing !
but had no price tag on it .
the food is awesome .
they also carry a nice selection of clothing and running accessories .
i am a female and i value honest service !
another waiter brought us out our food .
they treat you like family .
my favorite is the almond tea .
_num_ days without air conditioning in _num_ degree weather !
went here for valentine 's day and it was amazing .
it was beyond amateur night , it must have been pissed off chef night .
wo n't be using their facilities .
disappointed .
of special note , chris is just terrific !
thanks , guys !
she finally got her grilled cheese sandwich another _num_ minutes later .
their salsa bar was great to add flavors and heat .
a charm that you ca n't find in most charlotte pubs and restaurants .
we would have stayed and spent more money but she was unwelcoming .
it 's like a small city inside .
the entire staff was hispanic , not japanese .
new place has better food , same cheap prices .
this place definitely gets big points for being friendly .
i ca n't believe housekeeping would even consider this clean .
snow during the holidays to play outside on the front yard is awesome !
never saw a check and did n't see him put anything in the register .

she did a poor job on my toes .
very standard fare but consistently good .

the cheese fondue appetizer was good ; but the entrees were tasteless .

i am hoping management reads this and makes a serious improvement .
easy to get to and from different gates .
super sweet associates and fast , friendly and affordable services .
they definitely pay attention to the children .
nancy is simply the best .
he said it tasted bland .
this visit was most definitely my last visit to the cheesecake factory .
this has to be some of the worst food in all of phoenix .

the best sandwich shop in las vegas !

this place seriously hit the spot .
they have so much cool stuff .

then you 'll love cajun queen .
paper thin and always kept breaking .
i have no problem with that , never did , never said i did .
my experience with the woman who helped me sign all the paperwork was great .
i could purchase that for at least $ _num_ less at whole foods .
great sense of style , taste , and always honest .
thank you aj 's , you are the best !
not the service or the food .
the cucumbers were wonderful .
such poor patient care !
this inside gives you a east coast feel ... .
good local spot .
this use to be the go to place because the food was always consistent .
we spoke with the owner eric and he said that was not true .
well organized and clean .
overall , red lobster is becoming one of my favorite chains .
food was fresh and prompt .
really good korean food and very fresh sushi .
so happy to have finally found a good chinese restaurant that delivers .
every dish we had was completely flavorless .
worst customer service !
it was excellent , high quality and reasonably priced .
customer service is not what it used to be .
chicken parm is excellent and the sandwiches are a must try .
very fun place , great staff !
it was a hit for our mother 's day celebration !
i would definitely recommend them !
best fried pickles ever and the burgers are so delicious .
my potato came out very soggy , the steak very much over cooked .

i love it !
i do not recommend !
love the floor plans and all the space even for a one bedroom !

i give the product _num_ stars , but the staff only _num_ star .
i was pissed off .

a big thumbs up .
the bun was stale and the eggplant was soggy .

the staff i 'd also very nice .
the food was delicious !
amazing quality and service .
club had a great remodel .
this is after waiting almost two hours .
we should still get our dumb $ _num_ off .
it was freaking delicious .
great portions and fresh ingredients .
the baked brie was lacking in brie as the previous reviewers mentioned .
so our entire meal that day ended up in the trash .
love the community .
like _num_ minutes later he took our food order .
service is always prompt , even when i order togo .
worst sushi place , ever !
everything is well maintained and regularly cleaned .
they have good , fresh food served timely .
the biggest problem that i have with sky harbor is the layout .
i asked the server if the green beans were vegetarian and she confirmed .
there carne asada plate is my go to and it 's good .
this place is awesome !
what a shame !
great home-style korean food .
worst experience ever .
very pleased and look forward to going back .

horrible service in the bar .
this is the best nail salon in arizona .

great for lunch or dinner .
hands down best sushi !
awesome interesting inexpensive place .
the taste in my mouth was awful .
it said limit two so i decided to get another one .
bread selection and veggie selection is limited .
food was amazing .
the butcher 's block is always my go to .
beautiful outdoor design for the hotel .
all she did was continue to ignore and have a dude conversation .
aloha kitchen is mesa 's best kept secret .
we have always had great service too !
the cool thing was they had new exhibits and new activities .
great customer service .
great work and customer service .
friendly customer service , will definitely take my business back in the future .
the food handling in the kitchen is questionable .
what the hell is this ?
will be back !
there were no specialty cheeses or meats .
i recommend this place to anyone looking for cuban food in las vegas .
the customer service was great .
should n't have even delivered that desert .
the atmosphere of the restaurant is also quite weird .
thanks !
thanks for the suggestions .
just not very healthy because of the fried stuff on top .
it 's nice that the bar is separate from the dining area .
after i left , i noticed that there were scratch marks on the metal !
excellent service .
good company .

this was not posted on the menu , doors or anywhere in the building .
everyone is always super friendly and greets you .
food was medium at best , the service was terrible .
i do n't even know what to say except just go somewhere else .
they have quite a few rental guns and some pretty friendly staff .
stayed here this past weekend .
number _num_ !

well what it is will be for you to decide .
it is excellent with their black pepper sauce .
it 's unacceptable .
lazy !
priced just right .
one of our favorites !
its decor is horrible .
the hallways smell as do the rooms and they are not clean at all .
i picked up a couple of nails in my tire over the weekend .
tee time at _num_ pm .
and the foods were not the best they could be consider the price .
this place has by far the best green chili in phoenix !
habib is great !
this company should not be allowed to be in business .
fresh fish daily , extremely wide variety of rolls .
the chairs were filthy ( food , dirt , bird poop ? )
it was excellent .
always a great evening crowd and friendly .
just a cool place , excellent variety !
i highly recommend this store .
and the food just was n't very good at all .

i have ordered delivery twice with both times being delicious .
i always order the chicken feta salad and it was great .
obviously this is not `` quick care '' .
if i could give this salon negative reviews , i would !
pei wei is also a bit overpriced for what it is .
food was very good and reasonably priced .
when we stepped in , i was excited .
food is very good , so far everything we ever ate was delicious .
the staff is always friendly .
i wo n't give these people a dime of my money .
perfect spot .
the clientele also leaves something to be desired .
we were pretty disappointed in how the staff handled themselves .
he has always done an excellent job at an affordable price .
my salad came out shortly after the appetizer sliders .
big fan of mexican food .
served hot and really hit the spot .

i 've been here twice and i loved it everytime .
this is one of my favorite restaurants in town .
it is fun even with the older folks .

worth it for a special night out ( anniversary , etc . )
this place had made so difficult to adopt a puppy .
no credit .
no line , no rush to purchase tickets .
i then called that night and spoke with george b , a manager .
food was mediocre .
my cup of coffee was not even 1/2 way full .
good food !
it is extremely over-priced for what you get out of it .
she told me no , that type of technology does n't exist .
today i visited and it was the worst !
i love this place .
absolute favorite place for sushi .
safeway and frys have much nicer people and better prices .
the meat was very flavorful and a mixture of crispy and juicy .
there was no cheese on my husband 's chimi .
but huge portions of well prepared grub and excellent prices .
really loved this place .
probably give it another shot but not my first choice considering the prices .
the kinda coyote ugly themed bar is nothing but plain and stupid .
but everything else i 've had has been delicious .

hole-in-the-wall or not ... do n't need to come back to this place .
_num_ of _num_ items were not cooked properly .
the chili was great but a little spicy for my taste .

like they built it in the basement of some _num_ 's ranch house .
well , plans changed and we were starving so there it is .
great customer service .
these doughnuts are delicious .
it was quite obvious the staff does not like same sex couples .
did n't even want to be bothered .
he cuts great traditional cuts and is friendly .
sick !
i included pics as well !
she had a bad attitude and was even offensive when asked a question .
no decision was made so i just started to drive .
a vegas institution with expertly executed breakfasts and other traditional comfort food .
suffice it to say i will not be going to this saver 's again .
real stuff , all good , all tasty .

solid group of guys .
but oh , how the standards have fallen !
ha ha ... joke is on you !
a complete waste of time that i will not repeat .
really got ta stop coming to this chain .
it 's inexpensive and tasty .
no one was uptown and the place was completely empty .
i 'm a regular here and i really appreciate how they remember my name .
this is a poorly run business that could be turned into something great .
of course he refused .
great service and food .
nice outside bar area .

he said `` what do you mean corporate - i am corporate '' .
they did n't .
i just hope she moves somewhere else .
my family loves this place !
right from the start i was impressed by this operation .
dirty and expensive .
they recently updated their menu , and it 's great !
very surprised they came from a chain restaurant .
they were very thorough with me as a new patient and welcoming .
especially disappointing was the mint chip .
pricey , but i was completely happy with my chosen entree .
always helpful staff .
bartender is extremely slow to prepare drinks .
_num_ minute wait .
been loyal customers since it opened .
unfortunately phoenix is slowly but surely returning to its roots .
all i asked for was sour cream and butter on the potato .
furthermore i week later i found my car 's belt system was broken .
there filet mignon is also very good as well as there ribs .
so thank you national for always being there for the business traveler .
i love this location .
best breakfast in west chandler !
he guaranteed that we would love our choices and we all did .
well i got ready to crawl in about _num_ pm .
this place has big portions at a great price !
david , the director of sales and catering , was a superstar !
there 's no pride in the service or the food at all .
this place just gets it right with quality .
the burgers , while being billed as `` big '' , are hardly that .
very bad food and very bad service .
lil commercial but i 'm still satisfied .
the dj ( tiny ) was great and the cake was amazing .
most recently , i got a birthday cake for my son 's birthday party .
it barely satisfied our craving for actual pizza .
probably wo n't be going here no more .
this location has been here forever , and it is worth going to .
the bagel was very good and chewy .
service was spotty and the food was so-so .
completely rude to me , my mom , and my son .
my enchilada was no better than any other enchilada i 've ever had .
not fresh , not flavorful , even the wasabi was bland .
i was surprised and impressed .
order it fresh with extra sauce and enjoy !
the honey lemon boba teas was excellent .
so there you have it .
come to find out they wo n't cover it either .
it 's fun .
really liked the lanes here .
best carnitas quesadillas ever .
great service , not crowded .
the chocolate calzone looked amazing .
my service today was outstanding .
but they ultimately overcharged me to the tune of double the quoted price !
pasta is amazing .
zach was an excellent waiter tonight !
i am never coming to this tropical smoothie again .
aside from that i 'd recommend it to spicy food lovers !
having several other patrons around would have made me feel more at ease .
will i get sick this time or not ?
good deal .
their shop rate is $ _num_ .
this place has gone down hill over the years .
waited _num_ minutes and still sitting waiting to be seen .
staff has always been very nice and helpful .
very comfortable bed and a great selection at the restaurant for breakfast and dinner .
i do n't get how this place is in business .
and then , they managed to lose our luggage .
i was very impressed .
then we had _num_ different kind of pho for our main entree .
did not want to hear any bad things about her .
she is very meticulous and did a wonderful job with my gel manicure .
not worth time , money or energy .
thank god for this place .
what a nightmare .
but the theatre is horrible !
great experience selling my gold wing on consignment .
hello , where 's my waitress ?
wow , i was disappointed .
for $ _num_ you can wash for _num_ minutes .
just all the way around an easy , convenient experience .
this pizza is very good and a reasonable price to boot .
on the cheaper end , very good food .
no testing of any kind that day .
yes , _num_ stars are very well deserved .
big waste of time and gas .
top of the line merchandise ... .
i highly recommend it !
they are huge hd fans .
i loved the upstairs lounge .
so i decided to run my car down to sun devil auto .
worst hospital ever .
service is always special .
boyfriend got the jack daniels pecan pie .
they also answered all my questions and took a lot of time with me .
she said she could n't do anything and did n't credit the difference .
i loved this place except for the limited choices .
the thai iced tea is definitely perfect .
very friendly and the shop was clean and welcoming .
the staff has been good and service pleasant also .
i am glad i discovered this place , and will definitely go again .
the staff is always friendly and provides excellent service .
i love this barber shop !
i wo n't be back again .
my kid is always happy going there .
overall a very pleasant buying experience .
great selection of cheeses .
terrible service !
this monday i found my car is dripping oil .
the asshole taking our order could 've be bothered with our order .
our rooms did not look vacuumed and the bathroom was not wiped down .
car looks great and is ready for the summer heat .
we went back to bartender again because she kept our valet and garage tickets !
some people like that i guess , but i avoid this place .
i love the deals i always find .
the fish filet hot pot is amazing .
our food took forever and when it got there i was highly disappointed .
one star is not low enough in my opinion !
you feel like you 're in a western town for sure .
the bartender was very nice and welcoming .
rude front desk staff .
some of the best donuts i 've had .
all the workers were extremely rude especially the lady workers !
good north and south indian food .
no ambiance .
the produce prices are phenomenal and fresh !
overall i 'm giving them a _num_ star .
one of our favorite places .
service is good .
excellent customer service !
really relaxing vibe .
i got a pedi and a fill with french manicure .
i have always had good food and service here .
this is our go-to date night dinner out .

very affordable and quick .
best rolls and freshest fish in the valley !
sometimes it 's watery .
boyfriend got a breakfast burrito , i got a shredded beef burrito .
great place to slip in to watch the game .
house takes tips from waiters then charges you again .
love their `` bowl of bolognese '' .
it 's gets very , very stuffy in there .
we ordered take out last evening from best wok .
the place is very clean and they seem to be very happy working here .
the mine tour was over priced and horribly boring and a waste of time .
it was really good !
friendly , funny and comfortable .
tucked away in the back of the plaza is a hidden gem .
the bread : perfectly salty , with a crunchy crust , and fluffy crumb .
these guys did a great job from start to finish .
got ta love this place .
great prices and very friendly staff .
this was almost the worse dining experience ever !
waited _num_ mins for tacos .
cold uncooked meat .
this was delicious !
it was cooked perfectly .
nice environment .
the background music was perfect as well .
the egg salad sandwich was ok.
i loved the ambiance just such a cute place with character .
no comparison between this one and rainbow .
plus they do a better job here !
the catfish was bland .
my family loves going here .
do n't remember exactly what i had but remember it was good !
best club sandwich i 've ever had !
best coffee in charlotte !
anyway , love it !
whiskey peppercorn sauce on the side was a nice addition .
it 's rather unfortunate it had to be a negative one .
we will definitely visit this location again .
we left with the hungry feeling gone but certainly no feeling of satisfaction either .
this place is a diamond in the rough and i love it !
the only good thing is that they have multiple campus locations .
my nails look no way professional , the service this last time was unacceptable .
wrong .
they probably would find a way to mess that up though .
washington , a great little hood and home of shiloh grill .
went here a couple weeks ago while i was in arizona .
the portion size is hit or miss .
avoid bell trans .
and the buns are super , too !
bottom line , we wo n't be back anytime soon .
caution !
paper plates and plastic utensils fit the ambiance , but food is excellent !
i love this place !
great donut selection and price !
good pricing .
they were really fast and efficient .
the food was n't terrible .
this is probably the best location in town .
the staff at this safeway is tremendous !
hostess was very awkward when seating us .
the food was amazing , service was impeccable and the view was just breathtaking .
no apology .
jimmy normally cuts my hair and he does a good job .
but i have wasted enough money at their restaurants .
so no explanation as we just sat there and continue to wait .
bed too close to wall .
i love to go to a family run place .
he makes us our own sushi rolls .
it just seems to have gotten sloppy and disappointing .
good food .
they were nice , helpful , honest and affordable .
but it looks like i 'll have to keep on passing on by .
when you first walk in it looks a little nicer then most salons .
also this is a clean , well-maintained location as well .
the pho was delicious and very authentic .
in _num_ years i have never had an accident .
it 's clearly a family owned restaurant .
it was decorated very nicely as well .
through the years , i still love .
bell trans would not credit my credit card .
thanks to a fellow yelper for introducing me !
friendly staff .

you 've been warned !
i truly appreciate the professional treatment , and friendly environment at acura of tempe .
made fresh daily .
i 'll make this one as easy as possible .
very courteous and classy place .
unfortunately , the sales people are pushy and rush you through the store .
the service here is always spot on , even during the busy lunch rush .
both were very fresh and had just the right amount of sweetness .
waitress said no problem .
the pizza is the best and it 's a pity they do n't deliver .
total waste of time .
it 's more of a family .
worst service ever !
pizza hut you should be ashamed !
the pieces were so small it looked like a quail .
friday night is apparently not the night to go .
great service .
amazing place and staff !
repeat visits are not very great .
i 'm not sure how anyone after eating here goes back .
$ _num_ plus two $ _num_ tips for one pizza and a small brownie ?
low pressure and she answered all our questions .
the spicy california roll is by far the best roll available .
i did see one lone maid 's cart but no maid .
it is by far my favorite place to go to eat .
as good as it gets !
the general tso 's chicken was over cooked .
it is so delicious that you ca n't resist .
i wanted them to , but they just did n't .
i have curry peanut salad , it 's good .
atmosphere , staff and coffee are the best .
checkout their rooftop as well .
i got a full body wax , she was efficient and fast .
i went with the farmer 's skillet and it was great .
great hot dogs .
perfect for a date night or a large group party .
then for the main course the homemade pasta was memorable and very delicious .
i enjoy this place .
i was in las vegas for the holidays and needed a fill .
zero stars .
i also love to buy my sushi making supplies here .
all of their teachers are not certified .
restrooms are not terribly clean , and in need of a major update .
the tempura shrimp is the best ... .
the shrimp and sides are great too .
the meat shop in the back offers some good selections for you .
it was my first time having fondue but it was worth every penny .
truly disgusted .
also i spotted a few homeless guys just outside sitting .
great job guys !
this place has chicago flair written all over it !
our dinner was excellent !
i was there to buy and the service ruined everything .

the ice-cream was really icy , the crunchy things were rock hard , etc .
great food , extremely attentive staff .
their menu has the usual mexican favorites and some good appetizers .
she said `` no we do n't do that .
saved us a lot of time and frustration !
many of us voted for artichoke hearts .
they have amazing people that help you find the perfect gift !
i 'm surprised how they could get their chicken so perfectly juicy .
the food is decent to above average .
lovely service .
the vegan ph soup is fantastic .
the corporate office needs to inspect this mcdonalds and remove the current management .
this mall is dead !
unfortunately , the rear window was just above our bed .
no call back .
will eat there again .
i have never has such a excellent experience .
definitely worth a visit and good , straightforward family style restaurant in green valley .
it will always be one of my favorite places to frequent .
( he said something rude along the lines of that ) .
each member paying high attention to quality .
breakfast , lunch and dinner are great food !
cute and charming , a great place for a first date .
it 's just a simple wrap , not much can go wrong right ?
everything here is delicious .
so delicious , huge portions .
very fine service and technician .
green chili cheeses crisp , bean burrito enchilada style so good !
the prices are just stupid .
you 're sure to find good food , good friends , and good times !
great atmosphere .
the cut always comes out right , the service is always great as well .
five people could n't see an opened table clearly behind them ?
customer service at this store is not their highest priority .
the food is not quite as good as before .
good thing i was n't a secret shopper .
do yourself a favor a visit this place .

clear and crisp .

i recently upgraded my internet speed on cox to their fastest speed .
they put so much masa in the tamale , it was ridiculous .
my dad finally got his food _num_ minutes after the table next to us .
fantastic local service shop .

dr george is amazing .
the poblano soup was was so tasty !
update from spring , summer and fall : the patio rocks !
the chili is pretty good and my son loves the pasta .
thanks michelle !
the atmosphere is quaint and quirky .
fresh fish - the toro is to die for .
you 're best bet is their happy hour and groupon specials !
the service is wonderful here .
their meat was overcooked and flavorless .
i 'm tired of being treated like a dollar sign ... never going back .
no patio furniture on the patio , a little strange .
a lot of very interesting video material let us know more stories .
oh yeah !
great place to enjoy by kids and adults .
even better than lee lee 's !
the professional level of service is unmatched .
this was the best thai food i think i 've ever had .
my loyalty to southwest is constantly being tested .
when we got to the restaurant , it was a bit bland outside .
the best french dip i 've ever had .
the crust tasted pretty bland , a bit like cardboard .
rooms are super clean , service is super good .
so needless to say , this is no longer our vet .
great carne asada fries .
why could n't the employees at desert ridge do this ?
i 'm livid and would not return here if you paid me to !
this particular store has very friendly and never pushy staff .
more like a child care service with mediocre food .
none of this took place , of course .
gross .
i remember the tin angel of the 80s and 90s .
plenty of food and a nice variety .
great place !
it 's a great little cafe , with all kinds of options for everyone .
i 'm not sure they know what they are doing .

very disappointing to say the least .

it was pretty slow .
thanks to pink jeep tours for a memorable experience !
upon my return to chandler i will definitely be back !
not too impressed , to tell you the truth .
the meal also came with a sweet and ripe slice of pineapple .
food was gross .
the baristas here do a great job of making specialty coffees .
in fact the pad thai was so good , we ordered some to go .
rudest , most disrespectful server i 've ever had .
go local !
parking is a ripoff and all signs in the building are posted poorly .
great food at great prices with great service in a great atmosphere .
employees are also very friendly and fun to be around !

the service was fast , professional , and affordable !
no big as it gave me time to walk the grounds .
going to spend my money at another bar instead .

( : love this place seriously .
no water .
everything about this place is awesome !
the atmosphere is quiet and dark , but the service is very friendly .
it made for an unpleasant dinner .
excellent happy hour special !
_num_ times this year _num_ business trips and one personal .
over the years , the interior has stayed clean and fresh looking .
talk about a great decision !
terrible service from beginning to end .
this place is so good .
right from the get go i was a little let down .
the beans were runny and the rice was also really bland .
the least they could do was substitute tenders in place of breast .
great diner -- breakfast , pie , milkshakes ?
i love this museum !
here 's the worse part .
it 's like the surface of the moon !
they are family owned and everything is very reasonable .
i would recommend this hotel .
she was aware i was short on time and did an amazing job .
so it 's a great place to go watch a sporting event with friends .
long story short i made the drive back so my kid got his food .
she really takes her time and is very skilled .
one of the best i have had .
the service was pretty good too .
the rate was great .
i will continue to shop in the future .
really good indian cuisine .
if i could give no stars i would .
love this place !
we found the staff to be friendly and a gold mine of information .

i believe she really needs basic training .
went in for dinner and was treated very well .
super tasty lunch spot !
thanks !
very disappointed with my monday night bowling experience .
kendra takes so much care and is such a pro .
personally , i do n't think i 'll be coming back here again .
i do n't even know where to start with this bad experience .
beans tasteless and of course rice same thing .
he drove away and had to come back for his money .
i 'm sure at one time the place was trendy - it 's died .
i love this place !
do n't do it , not worth it .
dr. moore himself is upbeat and cracks jokes through out your appointment .
absolutely horrible .
the rest of the food was mushy and bland .
really just a waste of time and money .
like that 's my problem .
some friends and i went for happy hour on friday and really enjoyed ourselves .
jerry or tim will do a great job .
i really like it here and will continue to shop .
she gives the best deep tissue massage in all of vegas .
i have also tried the pasta , and enjoyed it .
a girl has to look good when she hits the gym .
i would n't recommend coming here .
i have no idea why i return to this location ... other than convenience .
the best vodka sauce and meatballs ever.
scratch that , that 's an understatement if i 've ever heard of one .
worth the hour drive for me !
great job guys keep up the good work !
there nachos are amazing as well .
they are always very friendly and helpful when i ask questions about the plants .
she is an amazing stylist .
ingredients seem pretty consistently fresh .
convenient , easy and friendly service !

a tiny bit pricey , but worth every penny .
will not come back .
thank you luis , you 're awesome !
great place tucked away by the lake !
the service is average too , nothing really special about it .
service was excellent , food too .
when he gave me the bag i saw no chili .
highly recommended if you are looking for some good down home comfort food !
that was not a good scene and i barely touched food .
_num_ pieces of clothes for $ _num_ at _num_ % off .
sorry , cobblestone .
instead of telling me that they did back fills , she took them off .
great location and beautiful music .
great booths for sitting in with a few friends .
absolutely blown away by this place .
very professional .
it was n't anything spectacular as that can be ordered just about anywhere .
an amazing value at about $ _num_ !
steelers fans are the best !
peter piper pizza has better food than this place .
this is one of my favorite stores .
it can become quite dirty and cluttered as the night goes along .
great prices and knowledge of the older stuff .
i would definitely not recommend this place to anyone .
it was typical buffet sushi , poor quality and covered in mayonnaise .
thirty one minutes later , i was taken back to a room .
but only because it 's closer than chipotle .
well worn ( or should i say bad worn ) .
slowest drive through starbucks on planet earth .
the staff is very friendly too .
the salon is clean and the staff is always very friendly .
i am not a huge fan of italian dressing and prefer ranch .
the staff there is pretty great as well .
absolutely ridiculous must have over booked themselves .
i do not recommend this place .
fine whatever , so i got a bean and cheese burrito .
i took one bite and i was done .
it came with very delicious pico de gallo and red and green salsa .
and the hospital itself was dirt and careless .
if i were to go back , it certainly would not be to eat .
great service & scrumptious food .
i arrived two minutes late , checked in and sat down .
just love it so much !
wrong again .
always friendly !
the few sushi entrees that we have tried have been very tasty and fresh .
i was totally impressed - they made the whole experience fun .
have to say the service and food were very good .
the tortilla was overcooked as well as everything else inside .
the staff were very personable and friendly .
overall , a good experience .
the place smelled like _num_ years of smoking went on in there .
sale signs are n't clear .
the same guy is always there and is friendly .
amazing !
do not waste your time !
so finally i tried it and it 's great !
not vegan friendly .
the plants available are all big , healthy and reasonably priced .
also , this is a great place for breakfast .
i 'm so happy to have found this company .
the total was like _num_ bucks .
food is fantastic and _num_ % authentic .
_num_ .
their mild salsa was old and mushy !
i 'm in heaven .
very tasty , good sized wings .

my first dental visit in years and they were the best !

the food was great.
the food is fantastic .
the room was large , clean , and very comfortable .
i had the bbq tacos with their coleslaw and it was so so good .
very courteous service and just one of those bars that become your regular .
big huge mistake .
i love fresh wasabi !
service is always great and so is the food !
steak fajitas are amazing ( marinated meat ) .
it is the same fee to completely severe ties with the company .
hugh servings and the waitress was fantastic .
so , out of the blue there 's a fee after a few months .
alway worth the drive to decatur .
a bit pricey , but good food and huge portions .
avoid !
great pizza and even better service .
this is the first time i ordered prime rib here .
_num_ there service is awful , _num_ there prices are awful .

the food is amazing !
he went above and beyond to help us !
i put it back into the bowl and threw it away .
service is okay not bad .
best place to eat ever !
it 's just great .
wtf is that crap ?
i wish i could leave some sort of `` negative star '' .
they messed up tacos , how can a mexican place mess up tacos ?
they gave me a refund but did n't even apologize or offer explanation .
gives you a home feeling with the table settings !
why do n't you hire some people to process calls ?
mine was better , but i 've forgotten what it was .
breakfast mediocre .
the past three times i 've been i was very disappointed .
i wish it was closer , but it 's worth the trip .
great dentist , organized staff .
bottom line : the order was wrong .
i love this location .
the food is n't bad but is n't spectacular by any means .
i love lulu 's pan fried noodles !
shame on you racist workers for treating us like that .
needless to say ... i will never go there again !
they deliver when promised for a great price .
if you are in the area , it 's worth a quick stop .
1st time here and i love their frozen custard .

the duck confit came out and it was incredibly dry and stringy .
wow !

service was excellent .
do n't let the neighborhood or the exterior scare you away now .
all in all a great addition to henderson !

very reasonable prices .

so thrilled that steve l got me there !
this was my third time going to vegas .
the thin crust must be one of the best i 've ever had .
i was told , absolutely no trouble , come on by !
excellent southern italian style dishes .
great salon !
not enough veggies or peanuts ( which seemed kind of stale ) .
hello ... it 's dairy queen !
the dishes come out with way too much sauce .
nice little gifts to bring home .
that was not very customer focused .
great food , great people , quick to order and lots of fun .
i can work out , eat , do a spa service , and relax .

so my husband and i ate here last night and we left totally disappointed .

they failed to top off any of the fluids at all .
i love the great indoors !
i really enjoyed myself .

enough to win me over , even .

the spring rolls are greasy and room temperature and the tofu is pretty nasty .
well worth a visit .
the check in was a pleasant and welcoming experience .
this one was clean ... even the usual sticky syrup containers were clean !

fish was cooked perfectly .
our drinks were not refilled during our entire luncheon .
it gets better ... .

this place is a real treat and loved the decor .
the only thing that seemed to have any flavor was the rice .
then she brought a pinch more than a pinch of seasoning .

staff always seems to have a smile on their face .
the chicken was absolutely terrible .
always friendly people and great food .
i was not satisfied with this ihop .
i ate at sushi bay several times before and their sushi is excellent .
everything was handled and went very smoothly .
they keep coming out with new items to keep things fresh .
i will definitely be back .
i 'd prefer not to give this review any stars .
great food !
do n't bring your pets here for grooming .
so much to do there !
they said we did n't clean the apartment but we left it very clean .
very friendly owners ( family owned ) , very small place , great food !
once she got it back it was `` perfect '' .
it 's pretty darn great and convenient if you work by the capitol .
love this place .
we will definitely be back !
so bland .
it is crispy , juicy , and perfectly cooked every time .
there 's an `` old western vegas '' feel to bob taylor 's .
i had already started to get a bad feeling about this visit .
delivery was quick and the installation guy made it look easy .
best new york style pizza in the state .
shes horrible and the definition of bad customer service .
my cat frankie was lucky to get such great care !
the best part was the dressing .
_num_ day in a row coming here and i am hooked .
she said somebody would call me the next day .
four tables without people , all covered with plates and trash .
fries were a little soggy .
glad to see you 're back round table !
i definitely recommend bravo !
never stay at hooters .
i highly recommend his services .
this is still the best dim sum around !
food was excellent .
i did n't catch the bad reviews before my family ordered .
i 'm so happy to have found this place .
which is sad when it 's suppose to compliment the steak .
you can tell that she was loved & cared for while in their care .
amazing !
the fresh squeezed oj is unlike anything you 've ever tasted .
this is the worst doctor i have ever been to .
loved it !
all he said was `` oh sorry about that '' with an uncaring attitude .
food was good & worth the value .
wo n't come back again .
so happy i found this place .
i booked a car through hotwire and paid $ _num_ .
okay , not really , but the rooms are really worn down .
i still crave a good slice ( or _num_ ) on fridays .
best oil change in town .
both were excellent and large portions .
did n't taste any truffle and the hollandaise was minimal and tasteless .
that 's why i keep going back .
really great atmosphere !
no one did -- no follow up and no improvement .
overall , tasteless , cheaper quality in food , and dirty .
very very happy girl !
good location to visit madison , decently priced .
she gave the worst haircut and color in my entire life !
overall i will not order from rosati 's again .

they take advantage of people there , i do not recommend .
pretty solid _num_ hour fitness .
being that i live so close this is my go to arby 's .
one of the best marriott properties i have been to .
will definitely be going again .
i ca n't believe i drove all the way out there for that .
great side dishes and great sandwiches all around .
worst customer service i have ever experienced at an arby 's .
like it 's my fault you 're only into young boys .
still , it 's worth the wait .
what a wonderful experience i had !
great service !
everything i 've ever had was great !
however , _num_ hour and _num_ min later , our order arrives .
both of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals !
the chicken bryan is very good especially with spinach as the veggie .
some of the best sushi i 've ever had .
extremely authentic with very nice service and a good interior ( not great ) .
to be fair , it was takeout .
there were _num_ in our party .
the technique of the haircut is so poor .
the manager kevin is always so great !
budget should be called low budget and they are dead to me .
the staff are always amazing !
just a great golf course !
it 's a dive bar , take it for what it is .
wonderful cakes - a tiny bit pricey , but still reasonable .
no one should have to leave a movie to go complain to management .
i would recommend them to any one .
the new location is very nice , plenty of seating .
but , the food is really good here .
yeah !
to-go orders are also super convenient .
his service was exceptional .
i even tried a salad in an attempt to find something healthy .
first off , i want to say that i 've been here multiple times .
we were rushed to pack up and get out .
this starbucks is by my job so i 'm happy to come back .
will go to another event soon i hope !
it 's always empty and their prices need to be more competitive .
as though _num_ people was not enough .
quick in and out and the prices are great .
excellent authentic mexican cuisine .
anyway , the old lady manager at this location is horrible .
service here is pretty bad .
terrible .
they were dead cheap , too .
the food is fantastic .
worst er ever !
i immediately left the service area & proceeded to the front of the dealership .
unique and fun names to some of their signature rolls .
they do n't trust their customer .
i have been excited to check this place out for months .
it was quite possibly the worst ramen i 've ever had .
decided to go for their philly cheesesteak , which was so good .
amazing !
my husband loves steak and gets sick if this restaurant is mentioned .
my current favorite : the shrimp tacos .
service was good .
also had the sangria : tasted flat .
great service , friendly staff !
sweet !
the only , and most important , problem was that the food kinda sucked .
it was pretty much nothing more than over salted meat .
best bartenders ever !
we had the most delicious meal on saturday night .
maybe he should have been out there drying the cars .
after today , however , i 'm never going back .
i lived here for a year from _num_ and i had a great experience .
definitely recommended !
ugh .
i ordered their steak fajitas !
an awesome atmosphere with food just as good .
anyways he gave my the most awful gel manicure i have ever gotten .
their onion rings are also excellent as well .
great ambience .
a sweet little gem after finding my usual spot becoming inconsistent with their quality .
urgent care is horrible !
then repeated bye , bye , bye .
the bread is chewy and hot and grilled just right .
wo n't be coming back anytime soon .
price was n't worth what we ate .
i will never ever come to this place , not worth it .
excellent and unique dessert choices as well !
needless to say , i will not be making a trip back .

this place is the best !

look , their food is okay , but the prices are absurd .
Negative
this is one of the few times i wish i could give zero stars .

this place is horrible .
plus _num_ dogs !
great place to grab a good burger .

they are knowledgeable , helpful and honest .
conclusion , go to zen _num_ for the ambiance .

had i seen this first we would n't have eaten there .
the boyfriend got a cheesy red sauce concoction and really enjoyed it .

royal flush capitol of the world my ass .

i was completely disappointed .
i was thrilled to go and get my oh so favorite breakfast bowl .
my new favorite sushi restaurant .
i 've been here once since moving into the neighborhood .
the cheesy _num_ 's radio station did n't help .
even with the salsa the chicken was dry and the veggies were soggy .
do n't waste your time go somewhere else .
mac and cheese was not cheesy enough and it was watery .
eric , ashley and nicole are wonderful .
the selection is so overwhelming in a good way .
the wait staff are amazing and the food it delicous .
i miss einstein 's ... .
i gladly drive there and will continue to do so .
the management here is absolutely horrible .
also came with a large warm soft tortilla wrap .
staff is intelligent and attentive .
then the worst ... the cheeseburger .
always find something different here .
what a great team they have going there .
this place is awful .
great food great service !
i got _num_ thinly sliced pieces .
best in phoenix .
wow , what a find we stumbled upon !
i did that , and you know what i got ?
it was actually kind of a pathetic looking sandwich .
i pointed out that my fries were cold .
it was dry , overcooked pieces of duck with bones in it .
it 's horrible !
this place is worth checking out .
no letter of apology for serving roaches on my vacation , nothing !
i was incredibly surprised how easily we were able to get in .
it 's worth the drive from chandler .
we had a large party at lunch and they were amazing !
i was referred to drive for life and had a great experience .
the store barely had any good items and it was a mess !
so glad i found this place .

she is giving it two thumbs up .
and the fun part - eating all their delicious deserts .
thank you , ladies !
nice escape for a quiet lunch meeting !
the place is nice and clean and then the food i ordered is noodles .
the nurses were really inattentive and barely checked on me .
refreshing sometimes .
you have been warned .
this is right down the street from where i live ...
if you are in a rush , this is not the place .
fan in bathroom does n't work .
always punctual and the food is delicious .
very well maintained and excellent customer service .
great food and tap beers .
great service , cool atmosphere , and awesome food .
went here with a group of friends and the food was terrible .

his wife runs the office also and she is pushy and offensive .
was very disappointed with their online inventory not being current .
my egg salad had shells in it .
i really recommend this restaurant .

friendly , happy guests and staff .
my dog loves going to her , she gets so excited to see her .
this place is awesome !
she smashed it and then raved about how great it was .

this place is entirely too crowded and loud to expect actually enjoying a meal .
they also have very good pricing .
love this place !
is everything frozen and reheated ?
this has to be my favorite coffee house in charlotte .
i adore this native !
soooo worth it .
ordered in for a meeting and had a great response form our guests .
i promise .
all you care to eat .
it was too cold for the pool area , but it looked fantastic .
the bartender never came back to me to take my drink order .
quiet neighborhood , next door to restaurants , parks , nail shops .
unique and kids seem to love it .
- this place ca n't cook a steak .
has a very nice interior design !
always clean and well stocked with water , soda , coffee and even snacks !
i have always had great service .
for a quick meal this is about as good as it gets .
i 'm very happy and i ca n't wait to go back .
the price was so well worth it , too .
we always enjoy a meal here !
this starbucks is somewhat busy but , at mid morning the rush is over .
never been at a restaurant where you do that .
this is a nice , family place .
by that time , i just gave up on the party host .
it seems like they really go above and beyond to meet expectations .
service was awful .
very very professional & entertaining when helping you .

the curb side service is a nice , convenient touch as well .
the church is spectacular , and the patio is lovely too .

the old rancho would have never done this .
which they assured me was not undercooked .

the workers here were very rude to us .
they do n't c are .
nasty & dirty .
you guys do what you got ta do .

the worse place ever .
i was very uncomfortable around her .
good chimichangas .

i thought the rest of the meal was pretty good .
no such luck .
i am sorry but i am a business owner and used to work retail .

i went there for a tire patch on my rear left tire .
food delicious .
i went here hoping to find something affordable as i was low on money .
the staff is friendly and down to earth .
tables that were sat when we finished eating had already finished their food .
so worth the price !
the food was delicious and prepared & served promptly .
best egg rolls in chinatown !
both were very good .
this place is a great late night hang out .
free ice cream = an added bonus .
never saw him once , even after repeatedly asking for the manager .
i love their jewelry , it 's very unique !
extremely quiet complex .
sadly , the rolls were small and covered in sauce .
i would give it zero stars if i could .
i would recommend to any one .
we were very disappointed that we paid so much for soooo very little .
i have a very special order and every time it is right on .
and the warm cookies were amazing !
they were cold and more worried about money than helping an animal .
i never write reviews but this girl 's behavior was just ridiculous and unacceptable .
great service at this location .
they were not busy and took me right away .
i 'm sure there are other better experiences out there for chinese .
they had great drink specials and the crowd is laid back .
i 've been here for nearly a month and i love it !
we are regulars , especially at their new location !
one of the t-shirts was even by a local designer , which is great .
haha so sad for the works , they looked pretty stressed .
highly highly highly disappointed .
good chinese delivery .
my main dish was the filet -- what a great cut of beef !
i did n't waste time on that garbage .

cool decor and makes you feel like your somewhere else !

hell .
josh did a great job for me at the genius bar !

my fianc and i have had such an amazing experience with them .
romantic , a popular valentine 's day destination .

this place felt too mechanical and too shady .
they are amazing and i wo n't go anywhere else !
he really ruins the feel of fun .
good service food was decent .
we are always satisfied here .
they give you a lot of side dishes and will keep them fully stocked .
this is a cute little restaurant that i will always come back to !
i would advise everyone to stay far away from this facility !

the food was delicious .
we had our anniversary dinner here and it was lovely .
could n't believe it .
lunch buffet available , and you can even take lunch buffet to-go !
probably will not visit again by planning .
none of the salads are included with the entrees .
i love it here .
i recommend them to all my clients even if it is a drive !
it did n't wow me .
i also like the fact that they play some independent fare .
i would not recommend it .
this was terribly inconvenient .
they also have some happy hour specials and some other great drinks as well .
i 'm very disappointed in this place .
no bueno , nothing to write home about .
another fine dinner at china village .
their service was exceptional .
i greeted one of the deli workers and she again said nothing .

even before we saw the roach the food was disgusting .
this place is great !
also missing , fork , napkins , condiments and the traditional fortune cookie .
clean , stylish , and good food .
the bartender , makes the best cosmo in charlotte .
top notch !
the spicy tuna is by far my favorite .
the potatoes were not cooked and this is what set me off .
this is a warning : do n't go there !
still we were stupid enough to try it .
the complex was always well kept .
the deli people and the man serving the pizza were down right assholes .
ridiculous .
i honestly have dreams about your sushi .

a very pleasing experience from soup through dessert .

i already had my jeans in my hand and asked for my jacket back .
we usually share dan dan noodles too !
their bread basket is great .

great food and great people !
the lasagna was fresh and so were the raviolis .

my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh .
i think rosati 's does this much better .
the alfredo in the dark is definitely the most delicious !
the views of the city are probably my favorite feature of the city club .

pure bagel heaven .
spend a little more & get a decent mattress at a reliable business .

this public library was wonderful when i visited last week .

however , they absolutely destroyed a pair of pants i brought in one time .
fresh salads , sandwiches are tasty , and the bread is great .
it so original and well made !
we started with a buffalo mozzarella salad that was very tender and fresh .
this is our spot in madison for comfort food .
the food is tasty and the staff is friendly .
not convenient for an early flight .
not only is the service terrible , the management is terrible .
i absolutely love their food !
no sir no its not .
tonight was different .
it was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable .
it was fun while it lasted .
have eaten here numerous times over the years .
i had a great experience and i will definitely recommend them to my friends !
super nachos are just that ... .
the atmosphere is bright and open .
this location is n't worth your time or a dime .
quick , easy , totally worth the convenience fee .
... i love the new look inside the restaurant !
we absolutely loved this place .
just fantastic !
just do n't wait until you live here for months .
the cashier said then no money will go to west wing from your order .
no comfort .
this place is a rip off .
the broiled flounder was n't very hot and neither were my steamed veggies .
however , the quality of the food was mediocre at best .
i would avoid renting a car from here at any cost !
what a great deal !
love them .
i 'm impressed and will definitely be coming back .
we got so much food and all was amazing .
i do recommend him .
such a great low key place to go and have a great dinner .

great folks , nice tune & wax .
im very disappointed in this unit .
she loves the staff there and so do i !
never again .
ive really enjoyed this gym so far .
waitress had no customer service skills !

bathrooms are clean .
i sat and waited for my husband to join me about _num_ minutes later .
i called dr browns office and asked why they charged more .

the _num_ stars if for the delivery driver only .
Negative
i highly recommend it !

pretty good food for the price .
the restaurant was mostly empty .
very reasonably priced and a higher quality pedicure than i expected .
general tso 's chicken is phenomenal with vegetable fried rice .
it is top notch .
very nice selection of burgers , always cooked very nicely .
i thoroughly enjoyed my meal there .
also 1st street is a one way street .
based on my experience , i highly recommend this place .
the space is as versatile as it is impressive .
_num_ noodles .
drinks are made well and promptly .
any other city has better options for people than las vegas , why ?
i bet it gets packed .
please do yourself a favor and order this if you have never had it .
_num_ .
delicious pizza and really inexpensive too .
ran in , grabbed a slice each and ran back to car to eat .
plus 's - free wifi , no arms on seats .
almost every order i 've placed had something forgotten or incorrect .

he made our experience extremely pleasurable and the food was outstanding as always .
i was really impressed with our visit .
their esthetician service are equally great .
i repeat this was a bottle listed on the menu not from the retail .
the quality of duck was so-so , very little duck meat and too grease .
well , we just paid and left , just wo n't go back again .
the fries were lip greasy and mushy .
an honest to goodness pub !
she was n't doing a good job in customer service either .
one of the bottom _num_ restaurants in my entire life .
sales are very good .
not coming here again .
not expecting much , we had a great time !
the waitstaff was lovely and helpful .
if it were n't so convenient i doubt i 'd go back .

i love the decorations and overall vibe of the restaurant as well .

she is a navy veteran , served in war and everything .
after coming to this store , i do n't want the `` new '' .

the friday night fish fry was way overpriced and nothing special .
i really like this place .
i 'm at walmart and decided to get a burger .
service was very good .
let me start off by saying , i hate the dentist .
i was wrong .
they helped me explain how things worked .
if you close before _num_ _num_ than change your hours to reflect that !
why would anyone even pay for such lousy food ?
i drove past this place on almost a daily basis for a couple years .
good breakfast sandwiches , and also lunch .
but the guy who helped me was friendly and helpful .
person taking orders seems to be always pleasant and gets the order correct .
omg it was so good .
first off the location is n't the cleanest .
the price was very reasonable and the service was beyond compare .
very reasonable prices and you get a lot of food .
new addition nice .
their coffee is good enough .
delicious !
perfect !
the duck is moist and flavorful .
gary ate a few of his after he drowned them in ketchup .
the shop is always clean and service is fast and efficient .
the aquarium is stunning .
we should 've just went to a drive-thru and called it a night !
generous portions , and super speedy service .
viet food is below average .
it 's a tiny restaurant but the food is excellent .
one of the first places i ate in charlotte and it was certainly memorable .
no room available .
love this place .
they absolutely did !

no one followed through .
the restaurant is too small and crowded .
amazing mac and cheese ... i love it !
the next thing is the grooming dept .

even though this store is less than _num_ miles from my home .
good food .
the food is always great the atmosphere is amazing .
spent almost _num_ and a half hours there , entirely waiting for food .
sad the manager does not have to live here .
i 've been here about _num_ other times through the year .
the sides are real good too .
nothing special but not bad .
it 's beautiful and well maintained .
honestly you could share it with another person or two .
gon na keep it real .
the flavors were subtle , yet kept you interested in the meal .
i usually cook at home , and you know home cook is the best .
everything has been at least good , and some things excellent .
worst customer service !
i ordered the dan dan noodles and they were perfect !
erika was great !
the food itself is also always great .
they are hilarious & always have me laughing .
not good !
the margaritas were pretty strong and i normally drink strong liquor .
to charge .
so i feel pampered inside and out !
the store is clean and has an upscale feel .
i really think this is some of the best chinese food in champaign .
she probably thought we were poor people and could n't afford to eat there .
i know for sure she gave it to them _num_ times !
way too expensive for _num_ people $ _num_ ... for what ?
it 's not our fault you work for the tsa and are miserable .
i highly recommend this place !
flavorful and the service is great .
one of the best places for asian in phx .
food is always consistent .
unbelievable .
honest .
this is my new favorite spot to eat when i am in pittsburgh .
being they were so bust service was slow .
the filling in the hoagie was decent .
the staff is great and so is the food .
great outdoor dining .
this is not a four star coffee joint .
this is the 2nd time i 've been disappointed by this site .
delivery is always fast and they have coupons regularly in the paper .
i would highly recommend her !
the shrimp does n't have any flavor and just tastes like grease .
no sour cream on my burrito as ordered but we 'll move on .
served all day sunday coupled with their awesome chip bar , fantastic !
the rest of the food we 've tried was good .
$ _num_ all together and i love my nails !
they were way too hot being outside !
i highly recommend this place , nothing but a positive experience !
it 's authentic , delicious , and really reasonably priced , too .
best pizza in york co .
do not rent with the turn apartments !
what a disappointment all around .
sorry to use bad word .
great chinese place .
we also ordered some spring rolls and egg rolls which were really nice .
service was exceptional and food was wonderful .
that 's absurd .
pretty disappointing and overpriced .
and their lunch buffet is worth the price .
the price and quality just does not match up .
this is not a high end shopping experience .
excellent concert location downtown phx .
i have never had a fill hurt so bad .
great east coast style jewish bagels .
he was friendly , helpful , and not at all pushy .
no kidding !
the taiwanese sausage fried rice is good too .
the hollandaise sauce had no flavor whatsoever .
also , the people that work here were n't very friendly .
i would stick to the chilean sea bass .
smart choice on their part .
instead it was just made to look like a `` soccer mom '' cut .
she did n't say anything and just walked away .
excellent !
love my weeks that i get to see everyone .
poor poor poor .
one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas .
it should n't take more than an hour to make and deliver a pizza .
they were decent , i did n't have a problem with them at all .
their assortment of pho will have something for everyone .
excellent food , nice beverages , more than fair prices , & great service .
was a great ride !
great price , so convenient .
my clothes come back fresh and stain free .
over all my experience here is very disappointing .
great food , great prices , and large portions .
it 's been my favorite food since i was a kid .
the texture is far too gooey for my liking .
that 's it , no more trying indian restaurants in champaign .
sad , since this gym used to be one of the nicest ones .
which is great .
bad wash as usual and no customer service .
no one seems to be communication for efficiency .
worst ever shuttle service !
i was very pleased at their customer service .
genius !
subs so fast you 'll freak .
this place is amazing !
friendly staff , clean store , very comfortable women 's shoes and great deals .

as others have noted , the pretzels are really good .
every staff member we encountered was rude .
good hair cuts .
pleasantly surprised at the quality and portion size of my lunch .
the staff is nice , prompt , and helpful in their explanations .
lots of dining options , and unique ones which is cool .
automatic low rating .
they are consistent with the quality of service they provide .
the draw is mainly the patio and the happy hour .
a very nice place for either take-out or dinning in .
price ... customer service.
i am quite impressed at how professional everyone has been and very attentive .
overall , great food .
i love morning glory for sunday brunch !
the tenderloin burger was very plain .

i had high hopes for the quality but i was disappointed .
there is always a line .
food is great .
it was awful .

i love the food ... except for maybe the chicken .
the room was terrible .
the cake di chocolate is standard lava cake ( takes forever to make ) .
rating _num_ and half .
we were _num_ of _num_ units that got hit that night .
great choices for fish .
bar tender is on speed and sucks .
i never knew how bad they treat customers until i had a problem .
lucky las vegas .
and they have the best orange chicken .
but to their credit , everything is always delicious .
maintenance is clearly not a priority .
seems like the management and service needs to get it together .
descent service , quiet location , clean and friendly .
i 'm disappointed to say i 'll be avoiding this one for now on .
truly delicious .
all the staff was friendly and dr. price was fantastic !

this is the worst westin i 've ever stayed in .
i headed here to grab a gift on my way to a bachelor party .
avoid the buffalo chicken , just get the plain .

this did not upset me as i understand that things happen .
you 'll get in here and have a great meal .
great little irish bar !
both the hummus and salad were perfect and tasted fresh .
very cool place to relax and enjoy a good drink .
great little patio with good food .

the buns are made in the restaurant so are always fresh .
i could n't eat any of it .
happened to be restaurant week and the three course meal was delicious .
i 've had better tasting carnitas for half as much .
my two favorite are nam and michelle , they do a great job .
they did an excellent job .

the food was not good .

everyone was so friendly and attentive .
that is where you will find us !

it was awkward and frustrating .
the salon is easy to get to and they go the extra mile .

there are several combo meal here and it can fill you up well !

after watching this business grow , it 's growing the wrong direction .
the most authentic japanese restaurant i 've eaten at in arizona .
do n't waste your time or your money .
she is so caring and personable .
they just looked at us and went on chatting .
it took us longer to rent our car than to fly here .
nothing is homemade and food is dry .
this is it !
i also love that they have organic roasted chickens ( yummy ) .
as a parent , i thought everything was so fun , even for me !
the service was great too .
they make it the way you want it .
we tried a salad and the new chicken , shrimp & sausage paella bowl .
the car has not felt remotely right since it was in their hands .
do n't get me wrong there are other bad and good companies .
thank you !
not a professional install , just a self install .
what a great experience .
their food is amazing !
are you kidding me ?
you 've been warned !
and at a good affordable price too !
ugh , impressed i was .
but no , i was still charged a flat rate of $ _num_ .

the rolls are large and the fish is fresh .
yes ... i admit it ... i 've a soft spot for southern food .
it 's sooo huge , but good !
the area is primo , but the situation is not !
this is a really cute spot !
they do n't answer their phones or you get an answering service.
one was completely wrong so they had to redo it .
go , eat , enjoy .
they pile on the meat and the flavor of everything is excellent .
a true sign of the quality of their work .
wo n't come back to this location .
great prices and selection brought me there but their customer service keeps me !
god bless the las vegas rescue mission for so much love and hope !

then they rescheduled my appt due to doctor leaving office to deliver a baby .

the bartenders are excellent .
there are much better sushi places to choose from - even in az !
there is a wait sometimes , but it 's definitely worth it !
wait staff very attentive .
very nice concierge lounge with great service from bj .
the store is always clean and their employees are always welcoming and helpful .
they are never attentive , and i always have to repeat myself multiple times .
awful attitude .
super friendly service .
the food is still ok , but things are a bit dated .
they always have a good set of specials to choose from .
great prices & customer service , but please get wi-fi !
pat is truly an artist !
however , after the service , we were really regretted to see him .
i love this place !
my son loves the slides as well .
everything was served piping hot and was very tasty .
great food !
i wish i could give no stars .
very disappointed , will never return .
they also make a variety of fresh salsas and dips .
the wedding soup arrived rather hot ( microwaved ) and in a styrofoam container .
confirmation , that we did indeed get scammed by this company .
pure , sweet , sugar heaven !
the food was so reasonably priced and i will definitely come here again !
i will definitely go there again !
works for me !
i 'll continue to make a guest appearance here from time to time .
the sushi we ordered was so good !
whatever you do make sure to never have him as a doctor .

reason .
ashley was so friendly and knowledgable about the lines .
he is a long distance from my home but it is worth the trip .
under cooked and way too much sauce .
the other major downfall is the amount of bird shit all over the place .
the food was tasteless , not authentic and way over priced .
i 've heard a lot of things about this place .
the meat essentially had no flavor at all .
super solid meal overall .
it 's very difficult with a tub .
great find , great food , terrific service , and realistic prices .
i had the guacamole and mojitos , which were both very tasty .
no idea how this place stays open .
if every one of your employees was like dave you are in great hands !
but what they have is what you get , and that 's it .
awesome !
a little overpriced compared to other chains .
there is a wait , but she is well worth it .
i will definitely be back !
nothing better than knowledgable , friendly , reliable service and a good value !
this time esther assisted me , also an excellent professional .
really expected some unique delicious food and were disappointed .
pricing and customer service was great .
they have some of the best pizza in tempe .
no more ihop for me .
i love los tacos !

it 's loud and very informal , but always a great time !
got a french mani pedi and looking polished and ready for spring .
which has caused me to look elsewhere for nail services .
i dont think these people are not aware of what they eat .
the baristas were rude and pushy with their products .
the worst pizza i have ever experienced .
horrible mistake .
it took us a while to find our way to the entrance .

a great place for steaks .
when he came back , he just threw the bill and walked away .
i also enjoyed the lazy river .
if they did n't , that would be fine we 'd call someplace else .
your skills suck and i wont be going back to your store .
i 've witnessed how they treat their customers & they are respectful & patient .
highly recommend !
smiths on the other hand is worth the trip .
the chips were light and crispy but the salsa tasted pretty generic .
everything tastes fresh .
i adore samples of food while shopping !
soup with no crackers ?
a really fun place to watch games - especially for cards fans on sunday .

my favorite is breakfast ... the corned beef and swiss omelet is fantastic !
he is still fairly new to us .
i 'm so torn about this place .
and it 's kinda hidden , so you feel cool going there .
inspection slow and unprofessional .
bartender needs to go back to school on how to do a decent pour .
luckily , we were pleasantly surprised .
i 've had much better lamb elsewhere .
the breaded shrimp tasted weird too .
loved !

overall very good .
the prices are very reasonable .
where i wanted it to go up , it goes down .
big mistake .
it did n't taste bad but was not what i was expecting .
worst decision ever .
they had salt and pepper squid , which again was okay .
about a month later another tire had a leak .
it 's always the pink champagne with strawberry filling ... .
i will not dine here again .
rv bathroom and kitchen area were not cleaned .
i also asked to have my tires rotated .
the worst .
sometimes the service is a little slow , but always great food !
excellent experience all around !
they have an awesome new machine that makes coffee individually fresh .
salad with blue cheese and bacon was tasty as well .
even the french fries were sub-par .
it 's a gorgeous church that needs to be seen to be truly appreciated .
i paid $ _num_ to get nothing repaired .
was $ _num_ .
the fact that i have to explain the difference is annoying enough .
the staff is great from the moment you drive up .
honest to the bone .
subpar would be an exaggeration .
beyond great food .
i highly recommend !
the food was bland .
love this place !
this new management is the worst thing to happen to this place .
nice food when i have eaten there on occasion .
pricing is fair .
we waited too long to book and this was all we could find .
prices are very reasonable too .
this is a really neat place to have lunch .
worth the drive and will be back for sure .
a champaign treasure .
it is amazing .
over priced , and that goes for everything on the menu .
atmosphere is great.
unfortunately , our experience was terrible .
surprising sweet without being too sweet .
i 've always had a great experience at fletcher 's .
not of embassy quality - very poor property .
vacuuming was also poor .
he was professional and fun at the same .
the chili tasted like old , canned chili .
excellent eggplant parm !
every time i felt that things could not get worse today , it did !
disappointing : ( i expected more out of pf chang 's .
$ _num_ later , i have my laundry .
great folks .

she was having problems with her eyes .
i love steaks and this place does an awesome job of preparing them .
the place has looked better in the past .
the outside seating is also very nice on a summer day !
she is friendly , knowledgeable and clearly loves the work she does .
then i got new rotors , same issue a month later .
it was a fun place to hang out for the night .
the only dish that appeared worth ordering was the street tacos .
our orders were taken _num_ minutes later when other people also came in .
the ambiance was very warm and quaint and the food was superb .
the green sauce was just the right level of spicy .
olive garden soups are so much better and that 's sad to say lol .
)
i will return again .
he ordered his usual chicken burrito and could n't even finish it .
delicious fresh homemade mexican food .
their broth is flavorful without adding anything too .

wonderful staff and a very pleasant experience .

my entire office goes once a month .
always checking on us to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .
this place is tired .
this place needs some serious upgrades starting with the carpet and wall decor .
i complained to manager but she told me it was nothing she could do .
if i could give negative stars i would .
they were just _num_ trips late -- do n't ya think .
amazing food .
( no , really ) i have gone to this theater since it opened .
i noticed something felt greasy under my plate and turned it over .
my friend died _num_ days later , last night .
the woman wearing glasses is extremely unfriendly , impatient , and even rude .
great value , good price , and surprisingly authentic for a relatively small town .
maybe the flight attendants should do a quick check .
just had an incredibly unpleasant customer service interaction at this location .
easy .
they 're fried tofu is delicious !
bad customer service .
i 've had children at this school since it opened in _num_ .

best teriyaki sauce around .
they are always on time and it is always a fair and honest price .
tiffany was our servers and she was and always is great !
a little off the highway , perfect if your looking for that local feel .
however today i placed my order and went to pick my order up .

one of my favorite stores in las vegas !
i ordered to start calamari salad which was fresh and tasty !
they seem to have a modern vision which i really love .
pad thai look like it was food colored and the noodle stick together .
awesome .
my seat material made it difficult to vacuum them .
movies , music , and more .
really a bargain price for the quality and quantity of food .
do n't waste your time - go somewhere else that values its customers .
the caramel rush is delicious but heavy .
will definitely return despite its issues .
when it arrives , it is high quality and very tasty .
everything is freshly made .
the vegetables were served last and were burned .
they have the best spring rolls and the best pad thai .
worst experience ever .
all you can eat korean bbq .
i thought the staff was kind of weird about the rules .

i did n't want another drink .
prices were very reasonable and i love going to places that are independent .
we opted out of appetizers and went straight for entrees .
the food is excellent !
but overall great place that 's hidden in the middle of nowhere .
that 's just disgusting .
jenny , the owner , treats her regular customers like they are family .
its about _num_ miles long , which allows for a nice bike ride .
they are slow and rushed to make every order .
i 'm still disappointed in this server .
i had an amazing experience at banner desert for the birth of my son .
i thought everyone was very friendly and professional .
umm excuse me ?
thank you , guys , for being awesome !

huge portions and truly authentic !
disappointed as we had a good experience a carrabba 's some time ago .
my friend and i come here quite often for their lunch special .
the chicken was in huge chunks vs the old shredded style .
the desserts were so rich and delicious .
the tempura calamari is wonderful , please try .
this is an amazing store !
just an unpleasant experience every time i have to fly through here .
this was the worst service and experience i have ever received !
however , the actual hotel room was very disappointing .
this company needs to run like a business .
the food is always great and served within _num_ minutes of ordering .
and if they did n't clean it that 's still bad !
so he ordered fish tacos and i got a taco grande .
useless wifi .
crispy calamari with salt and pepper was huge ripped off .

exceptional breakfast !
best car buying experience i 've had !
the people who work there are great to talk to .
the phoenix airport experience is horrendous .
lots of great exhibits .
our waitress was pleasant .
very happy with my pedicure and wax .
i thought both were flavorful and tasty .
will return when needed .
regular crust is good as well if you want something a little bit thicker .
not complicated to pour some sauce on the noodles !
unless you are in the mood to waste time , take a cab .
it literally has n't changed in the last _num_ _num_ years .
walker furniture has the absolute worst customer service ever !
the hallways smell like hot garbage , always .
what a waste of time , and money .

i wo n't be going back .
but today was a bad nasty experience .
it 's a thursday i hate to see what the weekend is like .
everyone was very nice .
outstanding service !
not worth driving out of my way for .
if you want good pizza this is not the place .
they messed up my entre and i had to send it back .
everything i have tried so far has been perfected in taste and presentation .
food is yummy and the live music they had thursday evening was a treat !
not to mention he hung up the phone on me twice .
i will always take my car to doctor auto .
the other thing i had problem with was their free wifi .

the meat here was cold and the flavor was awful .
so cool !
i took takeout so my review will be somewhat limited .
i was rushed to the pedicure chair .
spoke to the head nurse several times and nothing has been done .
but days later the place still gave me weird , dirty vibes .
please make this store bigger .
we especially love their pho .
they have great almond cookies .
i really enjoy shopping at smith 's on green valley !
bad food , worse service .
filibertos are individually owned and operated .

orders were wrong .
it 's obvious how little you care about our wishes .
